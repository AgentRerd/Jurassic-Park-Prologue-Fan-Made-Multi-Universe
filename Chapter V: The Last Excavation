*(The Excavation Site - Gobi Magnolia)*

One month had passed since the pivotal meeting with John Hammond, Ian Malcolm, Donald Gennaro, about the Islands and future. James made his way to a secluded military base near San Diego, where his shuttle waited. As he boarded the vessel, a sense of purpose filled him, and soon the destiny hummed to life, lifting into the skies. His heart raced with anticipation—he was finally on his way to see Denise at her excavation site for the second time in a long time, the place where she had poured her soul into the pursuit of history and understanding of the past.

As the shuttle ascended, wings folding down, he gazed out the window at the vast expanse of the Pacific Ocean stretching out beneath him, the waves sparkling like diamonds under the sun’s relentless gaze. A deep sense of longing and excitement bubbled inside him. He clutched the small pink makeup mirror she had left behind, its worn edges a constant reminder of the woman he loved. The thought of finally reuniting with her was the perfect distraction from the weight of his responsibilities and now actions.

minutes passed, and the shuttle began its descent, cutting through thick clouds. Below, the harsh, unforgiving terrain of the Gobi Mongolian deserts revealed itself, a sea of browns and reds stretching far into the horizon. The shuttle’s landing gear extended with a soft hum, and it touched down on the remote airstrip with a gentle jolt. The heat and silence of the desert surrounded him. He was finally here.

Stepping off the shuttle, James was greeted by a few familiar faces—friends of Denise, their features illuminated by the midday sun. They were gathered around a dusty Chevrolet Blazer, their energy infectious as they approached him with open arms.

“James! You made it!” one of them called out, waving enthusiastically.

“Honestly, I never thought in a billion years Denise would get you out here!” another chimed in.

James laughed, removing his helmet and slinging it over his hip. “Didn’t have much of a choice, she said she would tie me up to a chair and drag me,” he joked, settling into the Blazer. Everyone piled in, their voices filled with excitement, the journey now truly beginning.

“You ready to go?” Mark Udesky asked, glancing back with a grin. He was the closest of friends among the rest, knowing Denise and James since their first day. At 35 years old, with sandy hair perpetually falling across a weathered forehead and eyes that held a sharp, calculating glint, he was built lean and wiry, his energy focused and intense.

“Yeah,” James replied, the thrill of adventure rising within him.

As they drove through the Magnolia Gobi desert, the landscape shifted, revealing towering mountains in the distance.

Suddenly the Blazer hit a bump, jarring James from his seat. “You okay?” Mark asked, his eyes flicking toward him with concern.

James smiled “Yahoo,” he replied with a nerves grin, adjusting himself in the seat and fastening his seatbelt, inadvertently tying two female parts or even noticing.

The further they drove, the more the desert gave way to dramatic vistas of rocky outcrops and sweeping dunes. The air was dry, the sun harsh—yet there was something exhilarating about it all. The journey felt like a homecoming.

After more minutes of driving, the Blazer rumbled to a stop. James stepped out, and the heat of the desert instantly enveloped him. His armor felt heavier in the scorching sun. He squinted, looking around. Mark followed James to a nearby tent. He had a clipboard in hand. "Uh, where’s Denise?" James asked, his gaze scanning the site.

Mark’s eyes drifted to James’s armor, then back to him. “She should be right around the corner. Malina’s probably with her. I’ll give her a call.”

"Thanks," James nodded. 

Mark picked up his radio and pulled equipment from a nearby crate, designed for the desert's harsh conditions. "Here," he said, handing over the gear. "Cooling inserts and lightweight padding. They’ll help with the heat. Probably won’t fit perfectly with your armor, but it should help. If not, we’ve got a spot where you can ditch the gear, and one of the security troopers can stand guard." 

James took the items but smiled, shaking his head. "Thanks but no." 

"Ok," Mark replied, his voice carrying a knowing tone. "Just stay hydrated, alright? Last thing we need is for a decorated D.O. hero to pass out in the heat." He chuckled. "If you know what I mean."

"Haha very funny," James responded as he adjusted the cooling inserts under his armorer plats, feeling immediate relief as the padding began its work. Then, he noticed a piece of cardboard and tape nearby. He grabbed it, folding it into a makeshift heat shield to block out the sun’s intense rays. As he adjusted the improvised shield, he turned to Mark. 

"Hey, Mark," James said, "Speaking of security—how’s my detail here?"

Mark’s expression shifted slightly, his tone turning serious. “Well, they’ve got a strong presence. They’re doing their job, keeping the rivals at bay and making sure nothing leaks out before the official announcement. Honestly, though, I think you went a bit overkill with the D.O’s security detail.” 

James chuckled. “Wasn’t my idea—Denise insisted. With all the discoveries happening and with rivals sniffing around more than ever and recent mysterious sabotaging of other excavation teams, she wanted to control the narrative and defend her work. And trust me, she threatened to take my armor for the year. And let me tell you, that's not fun. Every time she borrows it, she brings it back full of sand. Takes a week to clean it out. It’s why I don’t like sand. It’s coarse, rough, irritating, and it gets everywhere.”

Mark laughed. “I can’t blame her,” he said. “But with the kind of attention this project’s getting, the whole world’s watching. And with your Dark Order’s involvement, one wrong move, and it could all unravel. We even had a visit from Dr. Alan Grant recently—he’s been itching to see this.”

“Dr. Grant? The paleontologist?” James asked, surprised. “I heard he’s writing something, maybe a book about dinosaurs. I’d love to meet him one day, but with my work, it’s nearly impossible. The only people I get to meet are heads of state—presidents, the Queen. It’s kind of boring, actually. You don’t do anything but stand around except with the queen, she keeps it fun.” 

James then turned to anther tent and saw a young boy at a crude workstation. The boy, about 12 years old, sat with his face lit by a green glow of a computer monitor, surrounded by wires and circuit boards. His brown hair fell over his forehead as he typed on a keyboard, his fingers moving quickly. Oversized glasses sat on his nose. 

“Who’s that kid?” James asked.

“Oh, him?” Mark said with a smile. “That’s Billy Jerry. He’s good with electronics and technology. He’s been a help since Walter and Denise brought him in. He wants to work with Dr. Grant. Last I heard, Walter and Denise plan to give him a role with Dr. Grant one day maybe 13 years from now.” 

Just as their conversation ended, a man and woman approached them, walking with purpose. 

The woman, 20 years old and dressed in a crisp white jumpsuit, stood tall, a stark contrast to the Gobi's dust and ochre. She possessed an angular beauty, her features sharp and intelligent, fierceness in her dark eyes. Her hair, the color of rich earth, was pulled back in a severe, almost militaristic braid, revealing the elegant curve of her neck. Her movements were economical and purposeful. Beside her, the man stood quietly. Rafael Santos was 40 years old, his frame broader and more imposing than Malina's. His skin was weathered from the sun, but unlike Mark's, his seemed hardened, not merely tanned. His presence was a study in stillness, a coiled spring barely contained. His face was a mask, his eyes dark and unreadable, betraying no emotion. He wore simple, functional clothes.

"Hello! You must be James," Malina said with a warm smile, her voice carrying a surprising warmth despite the crispness of her appearance. "I’m Malina Santos, and this is my husband, Rafael Santos. He’s not much of a talker." She gestured toward him, and Rafael gave a brief, almost imperceptible nod. 

James stepped forward. "Well, I didn’t have much of a choice. Denise threatened to drag me onto a plane by my ear and fill my armor with sand," he said with a laugh. "Anyway, nice to meet you both. Where is Denise?" 

"Follow us," Malina said, gesturing toward the main excavation site. "Denise is just up ahead."

As they walked, James couldn’t shake the feeling that something was off about Rafael. His expression was unreadable—too controlled. James had seen enough criminals to know the signs. Rafael’s outfit, his posture—everything screamed danger. James slowly reached for his helmet, placing it back on and activating the inner HUD, switching to x-ray mode. Kneeling down to make believe he was adjusting his  adidas shoes, James scanned Rafael’s body. The visor locking onto two knives and a Magnum revolver, tucked away in places James knew criminals always hid weapons. A shiver ran down his spine. Why would Rafael be armed, James wondered. He didn’t say anything, though. He kept walking, but every instinct told him to stay alert.

As they approached a cluster of tents, James spotted a figure in pink—a familiar shape he knew all too well. Denise.

“Denise!” James called, his voice full of emotion. He hurried toward her, removing his helmet as he reached her.

She turned, a radiant smile lighting up her face. “James!” she exclaimed, running into his arms. Their embrace was tight, as if the world had faded away.

“I can’t believe you came! I thought you wouldn’t because of the sand,” she teased, pulling back slightly to look at him.

“Didn’t have much of a choice,” he said with a seriousness, scanning her face. “You look beautiful.”

“Oh, shut up,” she teased again, a glint of laughter in her eyes. “I’m so glad you’re here. We’ve made some amazing discoveries.”

Before James could respond, a man approached—a tall, commanding figure with a presence that demanded respect. This was Walter Willis Granger, the lead paleontologist of the operation. At 50 years old, he carried himself with an air of seasoned authority, his face etched with the deep lines of a life spent under the sun and wind of remote dig sites. His hair, a distinguished gray, was kept short and practical, though a few stray strands were perpetually escaping to fall across his forehead. His eyes, a piercing blue, held an intense, almost feverish gleam, betraying the intellectual fire that burned within him. He was not overtly muscular, but his frame was solid, built for endurance rather than brute strength. He wore a simple, dust-covered work shirt and worn trousers, his attire reflecting a preference for practicality over formality. He had just emerged from a large tent that served as the primary work area. He moved with a confident stride, his gaze sweeping over the scene, taking everything in with a practiced eye.

“Ah, James! It’s good to see you,” Walter said, extending a hand. “Denise has told me all about you since your last visit in '71'.”

“Only good things, I hope,” James replied with a grin.

“Of course! We were just gearing up to head into the tunnel where we’ve been digging. We’ve uncovered some promising signs of are fight. You should come take a look.”

James raised an eyebrow, intrigued. “Your fight?” he asked, his curiosity piqued.

Walter nodded. “Come and see for yourself.”

Without another word, Denise took his hand and led him toward the tunnel entrance, flanked by security guards in black Phase I armor. The air inside the tunnel was cooler, the scent of earth and ancient history heavy in the atmosphere. As they ventured deeper, James felt a sense of awe at the history unfolding around them.

“Look at her go,” James said, a proud smile hidden behind his visor as he watched Denise expertly work with the team.

“She’s remarkable,” Walter agreed. “She’s been the heart of this operation.”

James nodded. “You know, she used to be a mechanic, back when she worked for the Dark Order’s vehicles company Gavril under my command. Helped design and made the first ever car Barstow I think it's called, in '69'. She was a soldier for a while too, before all this.”

Walter’s eyes widened in surprise. “Interesting... she never talks about her past.”

As they neared a section of exposed rock, Denise paused, her eyes gleaming. “Over here!” she called, excitement in her voice. “I think I’ve found something!” she yelled as he looked at what appeared to be a Protoceratops fossil in front.

James leaned forward, his breath catching in his throat. The excavation team gathered around, their eyes widening as Denise carefully brushed away dirt, revealing the fossilized bones. Then, something caught James’s eye—an unusual shape in the same rock.

“What is that?” James asked, pointing.

“Let’s see,” Walter replied, his voice low and serious.

Together, they worked carefully, revealing a second set of bones within the Protoceratops—a Velociraptor, perfectly preserved, both in what had appeared to look frozen in combat.

“Unbelievable,” Walter whispered, his voice filled with awe. “We’ve found them—this is incredible.”

And in that moment, James knew they had just made a discovery that would change the world forever.

*(The Tragedy of Denise Moreno Red - Plan 99)*

James felt a rush of exhilaration mixed with disbelief.

“This is incredible! You did it, Denise!”

Her eyes glimmered with joy.

“No, we did it, babe! We did it”

Granger’s voice broke through the excitement.

“Alright, everyone! Gather shovels, brushes, and tools. Let’s move carefully to extract these bones. This is monumental, and we can't afford to damage anything.”

The air buzzed with urgency as the team sprang into action. James kept his eyes on Denise as she worked with absolute focus, brushing away the sediment from the fossils.

“Babe, you got another glow stick?” Denise asked, glancing up briefly. James dug into his pouches, pulling out a light attachment and the pink mirror she’d accidentally left behind.

“Got it, and hey,” he said, raising the mirror with a smirk, “You left this last time after borrowing my armor... and after getting sand everywhere.” He finished with an exaggerated deadpan expression.

She eyed the mirror for a second, her expression softening before taking the light and clipping it to her helmet.

“Can you hang onto that for a bit longer?” she asked, turning back to the bones.

“Sure,” he replied, a hint of sadness creeping into his tone. He tucked the mirror back into his utility belt pouch, the familiar feeling of foreboding crawling up his spine. The air had shifted—something primal was gnawing at him. The Force, perhaps, or just an instinct that couldn’t be ignored. A deep unease settled in his gut, but he shoved it aside, but the disturbance in the force was strong.

“Thanks,” she said, her voice steady as she returned to the excavation. “By the way, dinner’s on you tonight, right?”

As the team worked together, James grabbed a brush and small shovel, preparing to assist.

“Yup,” he said, starting his task.

“Alright, team!” Granger called out, rallying the crew. “Let’s get this show on the road and done right” He gestured toward his radio suddenly. “I’ll be right back in a minute!” he said Stepping away into the darkness of the tunnel.

The air thrummed with focused energy as they all worked together, Denise and James moving in perfect sync. Their connection, forged in years of camaraderie, made the excavation feel like a joint effort—their shared thrill palpable in the air. As the final layers of sediment were carefully brushed away, the fossils of the Velociraptor and Protoceratops were fully revealed. The team of photographers moved in, snapping pictures with state-of-the-art cameras.The bones, frozen like ancient warriors in time, glimmered under the harsh lights.

James glanced at Denise. Her face glowed with pure joy as she lifted her helmet to see the fossils with her own eyes. He caught her gaze, the unspoken bond between them strong. Together, they made history.

“Look at this!” she exclaimed, awe filling her voice. “We’re witnessing... no, we’re digging history!”

In a moment of joy James, Denise, Billy, Mark, and Malina all gathered for a picture together to remember this moment in time meanwhile another team began placing a plate nearby, a special device with the ability to to encase what ever was placed under it.

After the picture, Denise grabbed her chest handheld radio, replaced her helmet, and pressed a button on the radio, preparing to call in the retrieval team. But before she could speak, a low rumble echoed through the tunnel, sending a tremor through the ground.

“What was that?” James asked, his heart pounding in his chest.

“Maybe one of the rival team’s working nearby,” Mark suggested, trying to stay calm.

“No,” Denise replied, worry creeping into her voice. “That didn't sound like a demolition. It’s deeper... more resonant. And it sounded bigger.”

Before anyone could respond, Granger burst into view, his face pale and his arms flailing in panic. The rumble intensified into a violent shaking, and dust and debris began raining down from above. “Everyone, take cover! Get out of the tunnel now! Abandon the site!” Granger shouted, rushing past James as fast as he could.

The ground heaved beneath them, and with a deafening crack, part of the tunnel collapsed. Chaos erupted as workers scrambled for safety, some of them caught by the falling debris, dieing on impact. James grabbed Denise’s hand without hesitation, fear of losing her. “Denise! We need to get out of here! Now!” he shouted, tugging her toward the exit as the Clone Guards rushed in to help the others escape.

Before they could make it far, explosions rocked the tunnel, the force shaking the very earth beneath their feet. James could barely keep his footing as the shockwaves rattled through him.

“James!” Denise cried, urgency in her voice. “The fossils! We can’t let them be lost like this!”

“What? Forget them! We need to get out of here, now!” he yelled back, gripping her hand tighter. But just as he spoke, the ground beneath them cracked, separating them by a growing chasm.

“James, listen to me!” Denise shouted, her voice strained. “You have to trust me!”

“What, No! We need to leave, now! That’s an order!” His voice wavered with panic, the terror of the collapse pushing him toward desperation.

Denise’s gaze locked onto his with determination, but there was a flicker of sadness in her eyes. “James, there’s no time for this.” Her fingers brushed against the small PPK holster at her side and with a small smile she spoke again. “Plan 99.”

The words hit James like a ton of bricks. He knew the contingency plan all too well—Plan 99, a chilling directive developed by Task Force 99, a rogue unit operating within the Dark Order itself. It wasn't simply a strategy for retreat; it was a self sacrifice directive, designed to allow a team to escape in the face of no retreat. The weight of that decision made his chest tighten, a familiar pressure against his ribs.

A sad, knowing smile appeared on Denise’s lips as she placed her helmet back on, hiding her expression. “Denise...” His voice cracked. “Don’t... please.”

“When have we ever followed orders?” she said, the ghost of a smile playing on her lips—a painful reminder of her rebellious spirit, the same defiant nature that had so often led her to disregard commands of both husband and superiors within the Dark Order the same words that had gotten her in trouble many times and almost discharged.

In the blink of an eye, she drew her highly modified PPK-X pistol and set it to stun, firing directly at James’ chest. The impact triggered his armor’s emergency distress signal as he fell back, shocked and gasping for breath as she turned and sprinted toward the fossils.

She ran and ran until she reached the fossils and quickly placed the specialized metal plate nearby under the fossils. She pressed its under button, and the plate expanded into a protective box, securely encasing the fossils inside.

But just as she prepared to move, two figures in black masks appeared, followed by Rafael. Denise’s blood ran cold as it all finely clicked into place—the teams sabotaged and Rafael's sudden appearance and transfer, this was sabotage.

Before she could act, they pulled out Beretta M9 pistols and the Magnum revolver—all customized to pierce even Dark Order armor—and fired in rapid succession. The gunshots were drowned by the explosions. Denise felt the searing pain as the bullets struck her 3 times. Her eyes widened in horror and shock. She knew she was dying now and today, never to see James again. She was on a timer. She stumbled, her vision blurring, but with a final surge of strength, she crawled toward the box.

She quickly turned and activated her helmet camera, trying to capture clear images of the three figures. As the explosions intensified, the ground beneath her began to give way. She could feel the earth crumbling, the abyss beckoning. And then, without warning, the ground collapsed, taking her with it.

James lay there, stunned as the security troopers, alerted by his distress signal, rushed in and began dragging him out. As they burst through the final barrier, a deafening crash echoed behind them. James, slowly regaining consciousness, turned. Dread washed over him as he saw the tunnel collapse, swallowing the remnants of the excavation site. He looked around frantically for Denise, but there was nothing.

The chaos subsided, leaving a haunting silence. Soon, emergency services arrived within the hour, summoned by the frantic calls, their sirens wailing as they secured the perimeter. Police, fire department, and Dark Order personnel swarmed the area. Troopers in tactical gear moved with precision, establishing a cordon around the site.

James stood at the edge of the collapsed tunnel, his voice hoarse as he cried out her name, desperation echoing. Dust choked the air, and the ground still trembled beneath his boots. He lunged forward, intent on charging into the rubble, but his guards seized him, dragging him back before the tunnel could claim him too. Denise was gone. Buried beneath tons of rock—along with his last shred of hope, and the moral compass that had once kept him grounded.

*(The Beginning of the Conspiracy)*

A few months had passed since the chaos of the tunnel collapse, but for Mark, the memories lingered like a haunting specter. The loss of Denise and other friends weighed heavily on him, and the unease he felt about the events surrounding the excavation site only grew stronger. Something about the whole situation didn’t sit right—it felt off, like there was more to the story than what he’d witnessed. One night, unable to sleep, Mark made a decision. With no leads and the incident marked as an accident, he slipped past the Dark Order security troopers of the now abandoned site to investigate himself.

The shadows of the excavation site loomed ominously as he crept through the darkness, his heart pounding. He knew the risk, but the need for answers drove him forward. Inside the remnants of the tunnel, voices echoed through the dimly lit space. Pressing himself against the wall, he recognized the tense voice of his boss, Walter W. Granger.

“Bill, we need to talk about what happened. I can’t keep lying like this anymore,” Granger said, voice low but firm. “You and Jeff and this Santos guy can’t just sweep this under the rug. Denise was one of the best paleontologists I’ve had, and now she’s dead alongside others of my best because of our deal. This was meant to be simple: you were to destroy the tunnel and take the fossils for yourself and your company. Nobody was supposed to get hurt.”

Mark's breath caught. He'd always respected Granger, but hearing him confront the two men Infront of him about Denise's death sent a jolt of adrenaline—and betrayal—through him. Leaning closer, he fumbled for the pen Denise had given him, pressing its top button to record every word.

Bill Steingarten, 47 years old and the CEO of BioSyn, possessed a predatory stillness. His tanned face, etched with fine lines, was framed by slicked-back, iron-gray hair. His pale blue eyes were sharp, missing nothing. Beside him, Jeff Rossiter, 36 years old and a high-ranking executive at BioSyn, practically vibrated with nervous energy. A perpetual flush colored his face, which was framed by close-cropped brown hair already beginning to recede. His movements were quick, almost jerky, and a subtle twitch played at the corner of his left eye. 

Bill’s reply was smooth, dismissive. “Walter, accidents happen in your line of work. You know that. It’s unfortunate what happened to her and the rest, but that’s collateral damage. Not my problem but yours.”

“Are you serious? A Dark Order agent’s wife is dead!” Granger’s voice rose, raw with anger. “This wasn’t an accident—you murdered her. How long do you think it’ll take the Dark Order to find out? They’re not some simple FBI task force with limitations! You cut corners and so will they, an important woman is dead and so are many innocent lives. James and the families of the workers you killed, deserve justice. I won’t let you get away with this anymore. I’m reporting you to the police, even if it exposes me.”

Mark’s heart raced. Granger was about to expose them—and himself—when a sharp click echoed through the tunnel.

His eyes widened in horror as Rafael Santos drew his Magnum from his jacket, barrel glinting. “You should’ve kept your mouth shut, Walter,” Rafael sneered, finger tightening on the trigger.

“No!” Granger shouted as he tried to garb the barrel—but too late. The gunshot reverberated, and his body crumpled.

Mark sprinted through the tunnel in terror, dropping the pen, his mind reeling. He’d just witnessed a murder—and now he carried the truth. But as he turned a corner, panic seized him. The pen, the evidence, slipped from his grasp.

Footsteps pounded behind him. Rossiter, Steingarten, and Rafael had noticed him and were in pursuit, voices sharp.

“Find him!” Steingarten barked, his tone laced with fury. “He must not escape!”

Mark’s instincts kicked in. He bolted down the tunnel, adrenaline surging. He could hear Granger’s voice in his mind: “James and the families of the workers you killed, deserve justice…” The words fueled his desperation—but the reality of his situation was closing in fast. He had lost the recording, and now he was running for his life.

He burst out of the tunnel into the open air, the night sky stretching above him. No time to breathe. He glanced back and saw Steingarten and Rafael emerging from the darkness—but Jeff, spotting cameras ahead, suddenly stopped. He wouldn’t risk being seen on the Dark Order’s CCTV. “Let the troopers handle it,” Steingarten muttered, stepping back into the shadows. In the distance, Mark had spotted the group of Dark Order troopers—part of the security detail James had stationed. He ran toward them, hoping for protection. But as he approached Steingarten shouted from behind. “Get him!” 

The commander of the squad, MT-1130 Captain Samsung, a veteran with black Imperial class sand-trooper armor, having served 150 years with an age appearance of 50 and gray hair along with a scar and a white blind eye on his left, turned, putting on his helmet. His voice was ice. “Blast him!” and Mark’s blood ran cold. These men weren’t loyal—they’d been bribed, a sharp interdiction to the emperor's words of loyalty.

Mark spun and sprinted in the opposite direction, the troopers opening fire. He ducked into an outpost, his breath ragged. Inside, he spotted a security camera—still recording. He ripped out the tape, clutching it like a lifeline. Evidence—maybe.

He burst back outside, the troopers closing in. He needed to disappear—now.

Darting into the parking section of the site, he spotted his Chevy Blazer. He wrenched open the door, fingers flying beneath the dashboard as he hotwired the suv. The engine roared to life, and he slammed the accelerator, tires kicking up sand as he sped toward the airstrip.

At the airport, he abandoned the car and sprinted to the site’s searching plane—a Cessna 310, its white paint chipped from years of desert winds. The fuselage shuddered as he yanked open the cockpit door, the leather seats cracked with age. Mark’s hands trembled as he fumbled with the controls, his breath fogging the glass. Dial by dial, he brought the plane to life—fuel pump, ignition, throttle. The propellers coughed once, twice, then whirled into a deafening scream.

As the wheels moved, soon they lifted off the dusty tarmac, Mark gripped the yoke until his knuckles whitened. Below, the troopers’ flashlights darted like fireflies, their shouts lost in the engine’s roar. The excavation site shrank beneath him, its secrets now buried deeper than any fossil and now, he had uncovered the beginning of the conspiracy and he would expose the truth of his Last Excavation.

In the distance, Captain Samsung tore off his helmet, his scarred face twisting into a snarl as he watched the plane vanish into the night. "He got away, sir!" a trooper informed over the wind.

Samsung’s grip harden on his blaster. "We’ll get him," he growled, "and finish him off. No witnesses." A grin split his face as he turned to the others, the white glow of the security lights painting his armor blood-black. "Keep this incident closed. No one can know—especially that b*stard Agent James."

"Yes, sir!" the trooper barked before sprinting toward the Gavril Hopper, Jeeps.
