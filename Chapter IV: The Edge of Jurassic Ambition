"In the pursuit of greatness, the shadows of our choices may cast longer than the light of our intentions."

After successfully manipulating the young child Henry Wu—who reluctantly agreed to align with his vision following the mysterious death of his professor, Dr. Evelyn Carter—Benjamin Lockwood steps aside from the project longer now to raise his daughter, Charlotte Lockwood with the help of Iris Carroll now caretaker. As Hammond's dreams continued to take root, the stakes began to rise with each meeting. The promise of a groundbreaking future hangs in the balance, yet the shadows of uncertainty loom large. Will Hammond’s vision illuminate the path ahead? Or Will it plunge them into darkness? The stage is set, and the adventure continues...

*(The Beginning Stages of InGen)*

Henry Wu, now alone in the midst of his new and early work, guided by John Hammond's relentless vision, embraced the lab as his sole refuge at the zoo. He was eager to initiate a series of experiments based on the genetic research provided by James and the Kaminoan leader Lama Su. Though Lama Su had little interest in terrestrial zoology however his respect for the military hierarchy within the Dark Order and James compelled him to hand over the cloning protocols without hesitation. 

Wu's first target was the baby elephant—the ideal test subject due to its large genome and physiological similarities to smaller dinosaurs. Under harsh fluorescent lights in a fortified pavilion, Henry meticulously isolated intact nuclear DNA from fresh elephant tissue, painstakingly removing contaminants and matching it against reference sequences in the Dark Order's vast databases. Shortly after Wu began working for Hammond, the entire operation relocated to California. This move coincided with the official founding of International Genetics Technologies, Incorporation (InGen) on June 11th, in Palo Alto, California, a joint founding by Hammond and Lockwood. Hammond immediately oversaw construction of InGen's inaugural facility—a substantial corporate headquarters and laboratory building, approximately 200,000 square feet, where the two geodesic domes linked by a reinforced corridor were now situated, their walls already etched with the newly minted InGen logo.Meanwhile, Lockwood had already initiated plans and preliminary sketches for an elaborate underground laboratory and facility beneath his own estate in Northern California, near Orick, a property he had acquired years earlier. 

By late 1976, after hundreds of failed blastocyst implantations and mysterious chromosomal degradations, Wu finally witnessed the flutter of a heartbeat on an ultrasound monitor. Using Kaminoan microcarrier vessels to nurture the embryo, he managed to bring the cloned elephant to term. The calf emerged pale and trembling, but alive—and as it took its first uncertain steps, the whole team felt the electric thrill of proof-of-concept. Within days, they had showcased the infant to the public at the Nairobi zoo, draping a woven InGen banner across its enclosure and ensuring press photographers captured every wide-eyed moment.

James, encased in his full armor, stood at the edge of the crow, helmetless. He watched the calf with a mixture of raw awe and profound surprise. That kid, he thought, his gaze fixed on the creature—the barely now seventeen-year-old Henry Wu, whom he'd met just months earlier, the one he had doubts about. In his mind "The crazy son of a b*tch had actually done it". Hammond, unable to contain his excitement, waved a cane like a conductor’s baton, eliciting cheers from onlookers that reverberated across the savannah. 

The success was undeniable. This proof-of-concept, the living, breathing cloned elephant, confirmed everything Hammond had promised. The news had to be spread, and James knew exactly where to take it. He sent immediate, secured reports to strategic contacts in Japan and directly to Masrani Global Corporation, a burgeoning multinational based out of Mumbai, India. Masrani Global, founded in February 16, 1973 by Sanjay Masrani, had quickly established itself in telecommunications. Only two years after its inception, in 1975, the company had collaborated with the Dark Order on a joint venture: the development of a next-generation peacekeeping vehicle, utilizing advanced Dark Order material for its structural and propulsion systems. This project had brought James into direct contact with Sanjay Masrani, the company's visionary founder, forging a pragmatic partnership based on mutual respect for innovation. 

Now, confident in InGen's potential, James initiated the next phase. He personally reached out to his contacts within the Japanese financial sectors and directly to Sanjay Masrani. InGen, he explained, was poised to revolutionize bio-engineering, creating a new era of entertainment and scientific breakthroughs that would dwarf existing amusement parks and zoos. In Japan, James knew, the public held a particular fascination with zoos, a fact underscored by their consistent profitability and the proven ability to draw crowds exceeding even the most popular sporting events—a key detail from Hammond's own analysis of the entertainment market. This inherent understanding of the public's love for animals, coupled with James's personal guarantees and his previous successful collaboration with Sanjay Masrani, paved the way for InGen's expansion. The proposition was presented carefully: the investors, both Japanese and Masrani Global, would provide critical funding to InGen's burgeoning operations. They knew Hammond's intentions and the ambitious goal he pursued. And they pledged, explicitly, an oath to maintain absolute secrecy regarding the project, regardless of its eventual success. 

The lure of InGen's groundbreaking research was only part of the equation for Masrani Global. Sanjay Masrani, anther visionary with an eye toward disruptive technologies, saw more than just a potentially lucrative investment opportunity; he saw the future. Masrani’s drive to push the boundaries of human ingenuity, coupled with James's personal recommendation and his deep understanding of the Dark Order's capabilities, made the venture irresistible. The potential for InGen's work, James argued, extended far beyond the immediate scope of zoological entertainment—it held the key to unlocking advancements in various fields, technologies that could not only redefine life but also transform Masrani Global itself into a global leader in multiple sectors. In essence, James presented Masrani with a chance to secure a significant stake in a future where the lines between biology, technology, and entertainment blurred, a chance to be at the forefront of a paradigm shift that could reshape civilization itself. The groundwork for InGen's global expansion was being meticulously laid, built not just on the promise of entertainment, but on a shared ambition to redefine the limits of what was biologically possible. 

But the triumph was short-lived. Over the next month, each successive calf would succumbed to a baffling suite of genetic disorders—liver failure, malformed limbs, early-onset arthritis—mirroring the challenges faced by paleogeneticists who, decades earlier, had grappled with the resurrection of passenger pigeons and woolly mammoths. Hammond, undeterred by scientific setbacks and driven by the commercial potential, still saw gold in the spectacle, He had Dark Order tech and they hadn't. He arranged touring exhibits of the surviving, albeit sickly, calves in children’s hospitals across Europe and North America. The revenue generated from these exhibits served to finance the underground genomics bunker laboratory beneath Lockwood Estate. After a year of hard word Wu had refined his protocols: utilizing Kaminoan knowledge to enhance his methods, he engaged in intricate trinucleotide repeat analysis, pushed the boundaries of embryonic telomere extension, and even experimented with mRNA scaffolding inspired by the remarkable preservation of ancient mosquito-borne hemoglobin fragments found embedded in Cretaceous amber.

After five relentless years in the newly built InGen HQ laboratory, characterized by obsessive work and countless failed experiments, Wu finally cracked the genetic code. In a diary entry dated April 3, 1980, he described the breakthrough: the successful creation of a stabilized karyotype free of deleterious repeats, achieved by cross-phasing Kaminoan telomerase inhibitors with human chaperone proteins. When he reported to Hammond, the older man merely nodded, his gaze already drifting toward grander horizons beyond the scope of a mere elephant. "Well done, Henry," Hammond said, "but it’s time for the next step. A much larger step."

But the triumph was short-lived. Over the next month, each successive calf would succumbed to a baffling suite of genetic disorders—liver failure, malformed limbs, early-onset arthritis—mirroring the challenges faced by paleogeneticists who tried to resurrect passenger pigeons and woolly mammoths decades earlier. Still, Hammond saw gold in the spectacle. He arranged touring exhibits of the surviving calves in children’s hospitals across Europe and North America, using the revenue to finance an underground genomics bunker beneath Lockwood Estate in Humboldt County. There, Wu refined his protocols: arm-waving trinucleotide repeat analysis, embryonic telomere extension, even experimental mRNA scaffolding inspired by ancient mosquito-borne hemoglobin fragments in Cretaceous amber.

By mid-1981, John Hammond had begun scouting locations for what he and Lockwood now officially called Jurassic Park. In gratitude for the Dark Order’s advanced cloning technology and James's pivotal role in gifting it along with the investors, Hammond tasked James with creating the park’s emblem. Recognizing his own lack of artistic talent, James quietly handed the commission to his wife, Denise Moreno Red, whose talent for bold, memorable imagery he’d long admired. He trusted her ability to capture the essence of a dream that was rapidly becoming a colossal reality.

They laid elbow-to-elbow at James’s office back in Brooklyn, NY, on the floor. The overhead light glinted off the white canvas, awaiting its fate, and caught the stray, Denise a 20 year old independent women, with her black hair pulled into a severe ponytail, she was slender, but the intense focus in her brown eyes said all, just like James she too was ageless. They laid at James office table armorless helmets and parts Scattered and disregarded. Like leftover meals.

“I’m thinking yellow here—it feels bright and inviting.” James said.

Denise dipped her brush into a pot of scarlet paint. Her hand made a single, clean stroke across the circle’s edge. "Babe, you know yellow fades. Red sears itself into the mind. I think red will do," she replied, her eyes focused on her work. 

James leaned back, observing the stark line. "But hunny, yellow just seems more… cheerful. Red might feel too intense." 

Denise smiled without looking up. "Intensity draws you in, does it not?" 

James tapped the floor with his gloved fingertips, considering her words. The red line pulsed with a primal energy. He nodded. "All right—I guess red it is." 

Together, they filled the circle with scarlet. The color spread evenly across the space. Denise then sketched a stark, black T. rex skeleton at the center, its serrated jaw frozen mid-roar. Below the skeleton, she traced two elegant cycads, their fronds curling towards the dinosaur’s belly. Finally, she lettered J U R A S S I C P A R K in crisp block capitals beneath the image.When James delivered the finished design to Hammond, the older man’s eyes lit up. He held the canvas, absorbing the bold imagery. He made no comment on the color choice, or the intensity. He took it in as the official logo for the park.

*(Planning for Jurassic Park: Phase I – Location)*

Soon, a pivotal meeting was convened in San Diego. The setting was discreet, chosen to minimize external scrutiny while allowing for focused discussion. Here, Hammond introduced Donald Gennaro, his newly appointed lawyer for InGen. Gennaro, 30 years old, possessed the sharp features and lean build often associated with city life, always impeccably dressed in a tailored suit. He carried himself with the deliberate precision of a legal professional. Gennaro would manage future investors and navigate the complex legal landscape ahead, serving as InGen’s corporate counsel and liaison to ensure all liability protections were meticulously in place. He approached the project with a professional skepticism that bordered on apprehension, keenly aware of the immense, unprecedented risks involved. His serious demeanor, almost somber at times, reflected a deep commitment to upholding legal and ethical standards in the face of what he clearly perceived as a potentially volatile endeavor. 

Recognizing the crucial need for an independent, critical evaluation of the project's inherent stability, Gennaro had brought along a colleague: Dr. Ian Malcolm. Malcolm, a 26 year old man, a cutting yet striking figure despite his relative youth. He was clad entirely in black—dark jeans, a fitted black shirt, and a leather jacket slung over a chair back. His dark hair was somewhat disheveled, and his gaze, sharp and intense, seemed to miss nothing. He was a mathematician, specializing in the relatively new field of chaos theory, and possessed a mind that saw patterns in randomness, and instability in certainty. Malcolm was quick to voice his concerns. His assessments cut through Hammond's optimistic pronouncements like a surgeon's scalpel, dissecting the plan's underlying assumptions. He reminded everyone present of the inherent dangers lurking within such a grand, untested scheme, his warnings steeped in the unpredictable nature of complex systems.

“Well, Mr. Hammond, I hope you liked the logo. I take no credit, my wife did the design, and your artists brought it to life in mass production,” James said with pride, though no one could tell as his helmet covered his face, but his voice said it all. “And must I say—you really did surprise me with your fast progress in the cloned animals, impressive—most impressive, your kid is proven more than capable.” James congratulated. “I’m just surprised you stopped this early on in the project. I thought you would at least spend another five years to perfect the cloning art. What happened? Were the elephants too boring?” he added playfully. 

“First of all, I enjoyed your and your wife's imagination with the logo, and I'm proud to say I will use it wisely, and second, it’s nothing like that,” Hammond replied, his voice steady. “The elephants were merely one step forward; they weren’t my main goal, and you knew that. To make this park, I needed to ensure Henry could accomplish the cloning part for the future opening of our park in San Diego, which we have happily named—” He glanced at Lockwood for confirmation.

“Jurassic Park: San Diego,” Lockwood finished.

“Though I think Orlando would fit better.” Hammond ended.

Dr. Ian Malcolm immediately interjected, his brow furrowing, fixing his glasses. “Orlando, San Diego? So, you two want to, uh, um, create a park full of monsters to be honest, living and breathing and not to mention dangerous monsters here in a public city? Are you both mad with desire to bring back extinct species that should remain… well, um, extinct?”

Hammond smiled at Malcolm, exuding confidence. “Don’t worry about it, Dr. Malcolm. Everything will be fine.”

“Yeah, yeah, until you’re bankrupt and killed by your own creations,” Malcolm shot back.

James, glancing at his helmet in a small pink girl’s portable makeup mirror—his wife’s mirror—placed the mirror down and spoke with concern. “Dr. Malcolm is right. We shouldn't do this in a city. What if it backfires? You know there’s a 55 percent chance it could.”

“Uh, um, 100 percent, you mean,” Malcolm corrected lifting and waging his finger.

James, with a hint of sarcasm, slowly replied, “Okay.” Then in a normal voice: “If it does, I want the chaos contained in a sort of remote area rather than a public city like San Diego or Orlando, where millions of innocent people could get hurt or worse, die. And I don't want to be held responsible for it—I think I've already jeopardized my job enough, you just have no idea.”

Hammond’s smile quickly faded as he absorbed their words. He hadn’t considered the implications in such stark terms. “How, James?”

“Look, Mr. Hammond, I’m no mathematician or chaotician like Dr. Rockstar over here,” James said referring to Malcolm's fast paced speech, “but let's be honest, there are many ways this could fail. The most obvious one being… well... What if one of the creatures escapes the park? You have to consider this. You’re going to need someone to hunt them down and bring them back into their enclosures, and if necessary, neutralize them—like a game hunter or warden. Either me or someone else. But if it’s in the city, it will only make our jobs harder with all the people. Do you even have anyone in mind who could do such a task aside from me? I know you've been thinking about it for a while.”

John considered things and began to think: could it be James or his current zoo head of security, Warden, Robert Muldoon? He respected Muldoon’s expertise, and his easy-to-adapt skills made him impressive. Little by little, John trusted him more and more with sensitive matters and sometimes family matters, he had become almost like family to John, he was a close friend, but before he could speak, Malcolm interjected again.

“No, of course he doesn't. That’s only more chaos to bring in San Diego—a fully populated area with chaos as it is already. It’s a lawsuit waiting to happen,” Malcolm added. “Dinosaurs were extinct for a reason, John, and if you’re not careful, they’re going to be here after us—assuming you succeed in making them and not just elephants in your secret lab—and it all goes horribly wrong, which it will. Trust me, and when it does I will be there to tell you I told you so.”

“Okay, then we need some sort of solution,” Gennaro interjected. “Ok, so John won’t build anywhere near a populated area. So now the question is: where do we build the Park? It has to be very far from civilization and have safety features all around so the future creatures don’t escape—if this future dinosaur park happens, which so far seems promising. Can your company, InGen, do that, John?”

“I think my public relations manager, Edward Regis, can do something about it and—” Hammond said.

“I’d rather you didn’t do this, at all,” Malcolm interrupted. “Not in a remote area, and most definitely not in a city. James, can’t you see you’re making a huge mistake? When this man is done with you he’ll probably ditch you like the rest of the other people—yeah, don’t think I don't know about that, John. This is a disaster waiting to happen. For God’s sakes, James, you’re meant to be helping me out here as the voice of reason; instead you’re encouraging them like some dam puppies or a kid who just found his dad’s gun”

“Dr. Malcolm,” Gennaro repeated, his tone firm, “I brought you in to evaluate the project, not to try and shut down this incredible venture or insult a respected war veteran. Yes, the project raises concerns, but if handled properly, this could be a marvelous investment if it succeeds. Let’s see how it plays out before we start criticizing.” Gennaro quickly turned his attention to apologize again. “I’m sorry about Malcolm’s attitude; he can sometimes be a little… dramatic, trendy as they say.”

Deep down, Malcolm disdained the idea. He knew that no matter what they did, life could not be contained, and most certainly not in the amusement park they were making; life would break free. He resented James for allowing it to happen and providing all the necessary resources.

James slowly closed the mirror that had been reflecting his helmet's front and visor, attaching it to his utility belt. He removed his helmet, then spoke, cleaning the visor with a small microfiber cloth. “Don't worry about Dr. Malcolm, Mr. Gennaro. He’s just voicing his thoughts. Now, locations for the park: there are these islands the Dark Order owns,” James said. “They were discovered in 1525 by a Spanish navigator named Diego Fernandez and sold to us in 1526. We tried turning them into bases but abandoned them in 1566.” James ended. 

“Why?” Lockwood’s curiosity piqued.

“Whoa, whoa, you said them? How many islands are there?” Malcolm asked, his concern immediate.

“Do these islands have names?” Lockwood inquired.

“And how far are they?” Gennaro added, ever practical.

“How much to purchase them?” Hammond asked, his interest clearly dominating his expression.

“Seven, and yes and far but not far, and not much,” James replied, answering all their questions at once as he opened a flip open map device. “They can be sold to you for a price that i'll have to figure out. They’re about 120 to 150 miles west of Costa Rica.” He pointed to a location on the map.“This one, Isla Nublar, lies about 120 miles off the mainland coast, roughly halfway between the mainland and the Las Cinco Muertes archipelago to its west, far from civilization as we demand and I think it will work well for your main park, Mr. Hammond. The only catch here is that there is a volcano, the locals have named it Mount Sibo and it's the sole reason why we abandoned operations there and the other islands. Then, further west, about eighty miles from Site A itself, are the Las Cinco Muertes, or 'The Five Deaths'.” James gestured across the map again.“The locals call this islands, Isla Sorna, Isla Pena, Isla Muerta and Isla Matancero but we call them Site's B, C, D, E. Personally I think Site B, is where you'll want your breeding grounds, the factory floor for your creatures.”  He continued, “And finally, there’s Isla Mortis, which we hid from public satellites—Site F, is located farther west, between Las Cinco Muertes and Isla Nublar, though it's positioned slightly outside the main chain. It can serve as your official research facility for my tech and your cloning and any sort of experimentation we want or need.” James gestured, indicating the distinct positions of the islands on the satellite map with Isla Mortis. “One park on Nublar, one breeding ground on Sorna, and one research facility on Mortis. All together, you have Las Cinco Muertes plus two, Isla Nublar, and Isla Mortis,” James concluded. “the only thing  left is the rumors, people get lost on these islands and never come back. The Order, alongside the Coast Guard, has been sending rescue teams after rescue teams to find them, but all that is found are skeletal remains. But they can be yours at your own risk. All you need to do is get your company to register them under its name so the Order can keep track, and they’re yours after a payment is sent.”  And finally, there’s Isla Mortis (Site F), which we hid from public satellites. That one’s separate from the others too.” James continued, “You can use Isla Nublar for the main park. Isla Sorna will work for your research facilities, and you can use one of the other islands for some sort of biological preserve to make dinosaurs and have them roam around like a free environment for studying. One park, one free, and one research. All together, you have Las Cinco Muertes, Isla Nublar, and Isla Mortis,” James said, showing a satellite map.“The only thing left now is the rumors, people get lost on these islands and never come back. The Order, alongside the Coast Guard, has been sending rescue teams after rescue teams to find them, but all that is found are skeletal remains. But you can have them at your own risk. All you need to do is get your company to register them under its name so the Order can keep track, and they’re yours after the payment is sent, just don't send small groups.”

“Great! So all we need is InGen, Hammond’s company, to sign some sort of form and pay, and you sell them to us just like that?” Gennaro asked.

“Yup,” James confirmed without a care, his tone nonchalant.

“Oh god, I got a bad feeling about this, like it won’t go well for any of us and people will die. Not that I'm saying this is going to happen, but the chances of bringing back dinosaurs are next to none,” Ian Malcolm muttered, his expression grave as he turned to Gennaro. “So you brought me here just to be ignored. That's great, that's wonderful. At least consider my warnings.”

James shot Malcolm a dismissive glance. “Okay.”

It was clear to Malcolm that James was unfazed by his concerns. He was determined to help create the park, and nothing would stand in his way. Malcolm felt a growing urgency to warn others without drawing attention to himself.

“John, just so we’re clear,” James said, his tone turning serious, “The Dark Order, as of right now, still isn’t taking any credit for the park’s disasters, deaths, or lawsuits. Or providing you with advanced features—so I'll take care of it along with Dr. Kim, with a few from our storage, essentially just old and out-of-commission vehicles and some under-trained troopers, volunteers for one year. After that, I will be forced to back off, and your company will have to fill in the gaps I leave behind. The Dark Order isn’t partnering with InGen or you—only me and it's from 1993 to 94 so like that you can operate freely its a win win.”

“Um, that’s even worse, Red,” Malcolm interjected, frustration evident in his voice. “You’re not helping at all! If anything, you’re setting the stage for disaster.”

Unbeknownst to everyone, what James was doing—participating in this ambitious dream—was illegal by his father's standards and the Order's regulations, and he was determined to hide it from everyone.

With that, the meeting concluded, leaving Malcolm with a heavy sense of foreboding. He knew he had to spread the word discreetly, aware that Hammond would need more investors to continue the project. The stakes were higher than anyone realized, and the potential consequences loomed ominously on the horizon.

A week later, Gennaro and Regis—on behalf of Hammond and Lockwood, both present—signed James's forms agreeing to his terms and purchasing the islands, a major step for John, but unbeknownst to anyone behind the scenes, James took the form and hid it from the Dark Order archives, falsifying its purchase report under a senator's name: Padmé Amidala, who went along to cover his tracks.
