*(A Day at the Dark Order’s Base)*

Five months had passed since John Hammond and Benjamin Lockwood meticulously crafted their audacious plan. They left Kenya and arrived back at New York, their hearts racing with anticipation, and checked into a hotel for a single night. While John slept soundly, wrapped in dreams of grandeur, Benjamin lay awake, wrestling with the weight of their partnership and the moral implications of their venture.

The following morning, they set out for the Dark Order Base. As they approached the base, they drove through a massive set of imposing doors that slid open smoothly. As they passed through the doors, John spoke jokingly. "Huh, maybe I should too—get some big doors for our Jurassic—Park. Maybe I’ll have them open dramatically instead of sliding."

Upon entering the structure, they were greeted by an Admiral with a name tag displaying his name, Edmon Rampart. He looked 34 years old. His uniform, a standard Dark Order officer's black tunic, was impeccably tailored, devoid of any superfluous ornamentation save for the precise silver and red rank insignia on his chest above his name tag. His brown hair, neatly trimmed to regulation, framed a face that, while relatively unlined, possessed a certain sharpness around the eyes—eyes that were a dark, observant brown. They seemed to take in every detail of the entrance doors and its Visitors with a dispassionate efficiency, betraying nothing beyond a controlled authority. There was a posture to him, a subtle tension in his shoulders, indicative of someone accustomed to command, to making decisions under pressure. His presence commanded respect, not through overt display, but through an almost clinical assessment of his environment. He gestured towards a table, where a detailed map lay unfurled,along with a bag of merchandise—a gesture that left both men in awe—as he guided them. The base was a marvel: a luxurious sanctuary where civilians could feel secure, all while observing the rigorous training of troopers in action and the advanced technology they worked with, live on display.

As they navigated the halls, following the map and officer to the Commander's office, they stumbled upon a vast garage filled with an impressive array of vehicles. From land and air to sea and space, the sight was breathtaking. Small crafts zipped around under the watchful eyes of the troopers and droids on guard, while larger vessels like Venators, Yamatos, Acclimators, Bismarcks, and more stood as proud monuments to the Order’s might. Each vehicle told a story of power and service with precision—a testament to the Emperor’s vision of forging a stronger bond between his military and the people of Earth.

Hammond and Lockwood exchanged glances, an unspoken acknowledgement passing between them. They both understood the unspoken reality: for the global elite—mayors, senators, presidents, and a multitude of other high-ranking officials—the protection offered by the Dark Order's specialized personnel was a coveted commodity. The Dark Order's Secret Service collaboration program presented an astonishing breadth of options, meticulously categorized to meet any perceived threat or operational requirement. These assets included various classes of Clone Troopers: Coruscant Guards, Senate Commandos, ARC Troopers, Clone Commandos, Clone Shadow Troopers. Additionally, their ranks featured Imperial assets: Imperial Royal Guards, Stormtroopers, Death Troopers. Further extensions of their military heritage included First Order Stormtroopers, First Order Snowtroopers, First Order Flametroopers, First Order Riot Control Stormtroopers, First Order Jet Troopers, First Order SCUBA Troopers, Tech Stormtroopers, Sith Troopers, Sith Jet Troopers, Sovereign Protectors—as well as a cadre of advanced droids: KX-series Security Droids, IG-100 MagnaGuard (Bodyguard Droids), BX-series Commando Droids, Droideka (Destroyer Droids), B1 Battle Droids & B2 Super Battle Droids, IG-series Assassin Droids, and the formidable Phase-III Dark Troopers. The Order's reputation for both wartime effectiveness and personal protection was unimpeachable. The sheer variety of available options was staggering, catering to every conceivable need.

As they continued their journey, the vibrant atmosphere enveloped them. Families laughed and took pictures with troopers, expressing their gratitude for their role in rebuilding cities ravaged by war and disaster. To the public, the Commander of this particular base had been a hero since childhood—a symbol of hope in tumultuous times. John envisioned a similar scene in his future dinosaur park, filled with joy and wonder with him being the hero of it all.

Amidst the bustling activity, they noticed several members of the United States Military—Navy and Air Force personnel—interacting with the civilians. Soldiers in crisp uniforms posed for photos with the black & White-armored troopers and civilians, creating a sense of camaraderie and shared purpose with joy. The military’s presence added an extra layer of security and prestige to the base, reinforcing the idea that the Dark Order was not just a private entity but a vital part of national defense globally, and an ally to the people.

After twenty minutes of navigating the bustling corridors, they finally arrived at the Commander’s office, and Rampart departed. John and Benjamin waited patiently for two hours, rehearsing their pitch and refining their strategy in whispers. When their turn came, they stepped inside, greeted by the Commander himself. He stood before them, a striking figure in modified red-and-white Clone Trooper Phase 2 armor—a personal relic from his early days in combat. A small United Kingdom flag adorned the right side of his chest, a symbol of his heritage and alliance. The color of his armor stood in stark contrast to the strict color code enforced by the Order: males wore black, and females wore white. His office was adorned with trophies, medals, and souvenirs, each reflecting his storied career and the deeds that had earned him respect.

*(James Red Vincent Fisk/Fett Moreno: Into the Trap)*

James V. Red leaned back in his chair, his youthful face covered by his helmet and armor. He gestured for them to sit, his voice steady but laced with curiosity and muffled by his helmet muffler. “Welcome, gentlemen. My name is James Red Vincent Moreno Fett—the ‘V’ stands for Vincent, from my adoptive parents, and ‘Red’ is from my biological lineage, and Fett from my current adoptive father,” James added in a joking manner. “Fun fact: it’s Fisk, but he didn’t like it, so he replaced the ‘S’ and ‘K’ with two ‘T’s. But don’t tell anyone, shhh.” He stood up and walked toward the door. “And Moreno, from my wife. But let’s not bore you with my many confusing names—just call me James.V. Red or Agent Red for short. Anyway, what can I do for you? And before you ask no I'm not a clone I know I'm wearing clone armor, I just felt a need to say that. I was born in a galaxy far far away in a planet named curascant ”

John and Benjamin exchanged glances, their expressions a mix of confusion and apprehension. They settled into the chairs, eager to finally meet the man who held the key to their ambitious plans.

“I am John Alfred Parker Hammond,” John began, his voice smooth and confident. “And this is my business partner, Sir Benjamin Lockwood. We came here with a proposition we’d like to discuss with you.”

James closed the door behind them, the sound echoing in the otherwise quiet office, and the many voices outside were silenced. 

He removed his helmet as he walked back to the rolling chair, setting it down with care before settling into the seat. His young face revealed, he looked 20 years old, no more no less. His hair was trimmed close, military short, and his eyes—amber yellow with dark pupils, alert—had the kind of stillness that watched everything. A thin scar cut across his right brow and cheekbone like a blade that never quite healed. John’s keen instincts immediately registered the youthfulness in James, a potential vulnerability he could exploit.

“Please don't mind the scar,” James said, a hint of humor in his tone. “Got it in 1915 during a wildfire in World War I, when I was trying to rescue an alligator, believe it or not. I was, uh... eight, I think? Quite the story, actually.”

John tilted his head slightly as if lost. “I know this may seem irrelevant, but I'm lost—if what you're saying took place when you were five, shouldn't you be in your sixties or seventies? You look too young for this timeline.”

A beat of silence passed, only broken by the crisp sound of James opening a Snickers chocolate bar. He took a measured bite. “Oh, Dark Order personnel like me,” he said, the voice now flat, without deference, “We're a bit of a special case. The Chancellor... well, let's just say he takes care of us. Age is a... flexible concept once you join. Keeps us in the fight longer. Don’t have to worry about anyone getting too old for the job and risking new lives. Though,” He paused, chewing slowly, before finishing the last piece of the bar. A faint smile, edged with an almost scientific detachment, touched his lips. “it doesn’t make us invincible. We can still be taken down, same as anyone else. But anyway, you didn’t come all this way just to ask me that now, did you?”

“No, you're right. It’s nothing to worry about,” John replied, waving a hand dismissively. “Now, to the matter at hand. I own a park down in Kenya— named it Animal Kingdom—really spectacular, spared no expense.”

James looked at John in awe before speaking. “What class of zoo are you talking about?”

John smiled. “It's a kind of biological preserve type of thing, meant to educate the people, really good at capturing the world's imagination. You should come one day. I also once operated a Flea Circus, but due to funding issues, I had to close it down. The zoo has been thriving since. But I digress. We want to create a theme park featuring cloned species—more specifically, aimed at the extinct kind—but we need to start a cloning program. I was hoping you could assist us with the process.”

James’s brow furrowed, a mix of intrigue and concern crossing his face. “And what exactly do you need from us or me, Mr. Hammond?”

“We require your technology and expertise, not to put too fine a point on it,” John explained, his voice steady. “We possess the necessary tools, but the timeline is unmanageable. With your help, we could expedite the process significantly. I’ve done the math.”

James felt a surge of conflicting emotions. Earth's history, especially the Mesozoic Era, had always fascinated him. This fascination wasn't just academic; it came from his marriage to Denise Moreno Red, a paleontologist known for her intellect and resilience. She encouraged his interest by sharing her research on dinosaur life and urging him to visit her excavation sites. However, his work always prevented those trips. Now, the requirements of his position had brought him this unprecedented chance, a meeting point of his personal interests and the advanced technology of the Dark Order. This combination of factors was unexpected, yet it could lead to something extraordinary.

James was aware of the implications of Hammond’s request. Agreeing would jeopardize his position as the Special Agent in Charge of the Dark Order’s Security Bureau of Investigation and he felt a surge of conflicting emotions. He hesitated. “I’m sorry, Mr. Hammond, but I can’t disclose sensitive information. If I did, we’d both be in serious trouble. Is there anything else I can help you with? Surely you did not come all this way just for that, too. Did you?”

John’s mind raced, but he pressed on. “I thought you might say that,” he said, leaning forward, eyes gleaming. “You know I’ve done my research, and I understand that your Order is facing financial challenges. You need funding to build more public facilities and military bases. We’re willing to offer you ten million dollars each for your assistance as a donation, and another ten million if our project succeeds. That’s a potential twenty million.”

James’s eyes widened in disbelief. “Are you sure about this, Mr. Hammond?” He asked as he looked at Lockwood.

John’s brow furrowed. “What do you mean?”

James leaned back and answered with a smile. “When I say this, I don't mean any disrespect, but I'm not as stupid as you may think. I’ve been trained to pay attention to small details like emotional shifts—like you. You seem way too happy about this, but then I look at your business partner and he wears the face of someone who’s not on board with whatever this is, which brings me to the one billion dollar question: What’s going on?”

John quickly began to feel the pressure of his plan falling apart right in front of him and Benjamin quickly cleared his throat. “It’s nothing, really. I’m fully committed to this Project. I’m just a bit nervous, that’s all. You know how it is—making deals with the devil and playing with fire. If you don’t mind me asking, what makes you think I’m not on board?”

James picked up his helmet, glancing at its black visor. “I was trained to read emotional cues, like I said, and—well—you look more than just nervous.” He regarded them with a mix of suspicion and curiosity. “If anything changes, Mr. Lockwood, let me know. I have to make a phone call.”

“Is it a yes?” John asked, voice laced with anticipation as he watched James dial on his desk phone.

“Yeah, yeah, one second,” James replied distractedly. He finished dialing and pressed a random button. “Hello?” he said, stringing together nonsensical words to lull them into a false sense of security.

While still talking, James subtly pressed a hidden button under his desk, deploying an MSE-X mouse droid. Simultaneously, he tweaked a knob on his helmet, activating its directional mic and audio relaying it to his surveillance earpiece. Without leaning in, he now heard everything crystal clear:

“What’s wrong, Lockwood? Why are you so worried?” John whispered.

Lockwood’s expression was grave. “What we’re doing is wrong, John. We’re exploiting their vulnerabilities. We’re bribing this kid for your gain. I should pull the plug now before something goes wrong—and someone gets hurt.”

James dropped the phone, suspicions confirmed. He bent to pick it up, covering for the droid. to return as Hammond and Lockwood turned toward him “Oops, clumsy me,” he said with a forced laugh.

Lockwood narrowed his eyes. “Okay?”

James pressed the real call button. “Sir, like I said, I’ve got these two civilians,” he began. “And they want something from us. In exchange—they’re offering to donate to our cause. They’ve set the price at twenty billion.”

“…Yes, I understand,” James said, nodding slightly.

John and Benjamin stiffened.

“I just need to know if that’s acceptable by your standard,” James continued. “I know, I know—you told me to run everything by you, especially after what happened last time. That’s why I’m calling about this project.”

As James continued the call, Hammond couldn’t help but wonder: What he had meant by happened last time?

“I promise this will be worth the investment—for us, and the Order,” he concluded.

John and Benjamin waited anxiously, aware that the man on the other end was someone important and made all the important decisions and they were right on the other side was the Dark Order Emperor/Chancellor Mounter Fett himself.

James maintained a tone of professional deference, conveniently neglecting to mention or say how they were attempting to exploit the Order’s—his own—vulnerabilities. Deep down, he knew it wasn’t the Order’s weakness they targeted but his own: for a fantasy and a world of illusion built on ambition, obsession... and something dangerously close to joy.

“Okay… Yes… Okay… Thank you… Bye,” he said at last, hanging up with a sigh heavy as a thousand contingencies.

James leaned back in his chair, the weight of his decision sinking in. This wasn’t just business. It was personal. Deeply personal. He wasn’t just letting Hammond and Lockwood into the Order’s territory—he was staking a piece of himself on this madness. He turned to face them, the smile gone. “Alright,” he said flatly. “We accept your offer.”

John’s eyes lit up. “Don’t get too excited,” James warned, tone turning cold. “Mr. Hammond, if you want me to help run your little science project, there are a few conditions of my own—if that’s okay with you.”

John paused but nodded, forcing a grin. “Name ’em.”

James didn’t waste time His tone turning serious. “First, I want my additional fifty billion dollars donated to all children’s hospitals near this base. No arguments. They need it.”

John blinked but nodded.

“Second, I’m in charge, and when I'm not around, you are. This is non-negotiable.”

A second nod from John.

“Third—security’s not on me. I’ll offer manpower, some vehicles, maybe a few ideas for your tech, but beyond that? You handle it. It’s your responsibility.”

Lockwood shifted uncomfortably.

“Fourth, if anything goes wrong—anything. Lawsuits, incidents, death—you take full responsibility. No protection from the Order. No clean-up crew. No deniability. You’re the face of it.”

“Oh,” John muttered.

“Fifth, you don’t get our scientists. Maybe i'll provide a consultant, but that’s it. You’ll need your own expert—someone who can handle our tech and your vision.”

John hesitated but said nothing.

“And sixth…" James paused, turning to look at them dead-on. "My fee? You can keep it as I said. All I want in exchange for my services and tech is the right to a baby velociraptor. Female. Modified to my specs. I don’t care how long it takes—I want her imprinted to me and she comes with me when this is all over. Why and how are my business that’s the dealbreaker. So all you need to do is sign the checks, tell me and whoever else you recruit we’re doing a good job, and open your case of Scotch when we have a good day. Now, if you don't like either of my terms and conditions, you're on your own. So go ahead, for all I know build your freak trap here or anywhere else in this world for all I care but I've been involved in far too many bad ideas by rich and popular people to listen to anymore bad ideas.”

John froze momentarily before speaking with a smile. "Haha.. Ok lets do it"

*(The Beginning of Lockwood's Downfall)*

After successfully negotiating a dubious alliance with James, a week later, Benjamin suddenly found himself facing an unexpected crisis. His wife had given birth to their daughter, Charlotte Lockwood, but the joy of new life was suddenly overshadowed by tragedy; dying during childbirth. Thrust into the role of a single father, Benjamin realized he would have to sideline himself from the project, prioritizing the care of his newborn daughter above all else.

In an unexpected development, James had somehow become aware of Lockwood's recent misfortune. A surprising gesture followed: he reached out with an offer of assistance to allow Lockwood to stay in the project longer. In what appeared to be an act of compassion, James arranged for someone to help Lockwood navigate the daunting challenges of single parenthood. This individual was Iris Carroll, a former nanny who had once cared for James himself, having served as his housekeeper and primary caretaker since he was five years old, shortly after his adoption by the Vincents in London in 1910.

A few days later, at the hospital, James arrived in person with Iris.

As the automatic doors slid open, James stepped through, clad in a utilitarian black body glove undersuit with an Imperial Empire logo at his chest's left side. His usual armor was absent, replaced only by the functional presence of his 1911 holster at his right hip. Beside him walked a woman who seemed paradoxically unchanged by time. Iris Carroll, age 40, her appearance precisely as it had been when she had first cared for James decades ago, moved with a composed grace. Her dark hair, devoid of any gray, was neatly pinned back, not a strand out of place. She wore a simple, yet well-maintained, navy blue dress of a practical, covered under a black coat. Her hands, though showing the fine lines of a life lived, remained youthful, held clasped front, radiating a disciplined presence. Her face, framed by a soft, yet firm, expression, held eyes that were a clear, unwavering blue. These were eyes that had seen much, yet betrayed a warmth that seemed almost carefully controlled, a testament to decades spent navigating the demands of both profession and personal care, yet somehow untouched by the relentless passage of years.

“Benjamin,” James greeted, his voice lower than usual, carrying a rare sincerity.

Lockwood, exhausted and sitting by Charlotte’s crib in the NICU observation room, looked up in surprise. “James? What brings you here?”

“I heard what happened. I’m sorry for your loss,” James replied solemnly, then motioned to the woman beside him. “This is Iris Carroll. She was my nanny growing up—more like family, really. I trust her with my life, and if you’ll have her, I think she can help you. She’s got experience, and… she knows what it’s like to raise someone with a lot on their shoulders.”

Iris gave a gentle nod and stepped forward. “Mr. Lockwood, I’m deeply sorry for your loss. I can be here as long as you need. You don’t have to go through this alone.”

Benjamin, overwhelmed but grateful, stood and reached for her hand. “Thank you. I… I don’t know what to say.”

James nodded, remaining quiet for a moment. Then, he tapped his holo-projector watch, the time blinking across the small display: 06:00 P.M.. His eyes narrowed slightly. “D*mn,” he muttered under his breath.

“I’ve got to go,” James said, his voice returning to its usual tone as he took a step back.

Just then, the door opened again as he walked out—and John Hammond stepped in, his expression shifting from concern to relief as he saw the child and his friend.
