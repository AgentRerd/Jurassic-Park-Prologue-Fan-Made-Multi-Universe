*(Henry Wu: Into the Trap)*

Benjamin Lockwood had fully committed himself to raising his daughter, Charlotte, prioritizing the demands of single fatherhood above all else as he navigated this new reality with the assistance of Iris Carroll now caretaker. As Lockwood focused on his family, Hammond pressed on with the project, fueled by an insatiable ambition that overshadowed all else. With the alliance secured, Hammond embarked on a relentless quest for a geneticist—someone fresh, untainted by established paradigms, someone impressionable enough to mold. He envisioned a brilliant mind capable of directing his ambitious goal, but the search proved more challenging than anticipated. It wasn’t until 1976, amidst the personal turmoil of Benjamin Lockwood’s life, that Hammond’s path finally crossed with the right candidate.

Another fateful day, Hammond found himself within the imposing, albeit somewhat dated, halls of the Ohio State University biology department. He wasn't looking for a seasoned academic, but rather raw, untamed potential. His attention was drawn to a young student, whose place in this university was clearly advanced for his years; at only 16, his focused intensity and youth set him apart from the older undergraduates surrounding him. This was Henry Wu. He was slender, somewhat unassuming, yet there was a sharp intelligence radiating from him, a sense of boundless intellectual energy that Hammond immediately recognized. Wu moved with a certain nervous energy, his dark eyes constantly shifting over papers, then to a blackboard covered in complex genomic sequences. It was the spark of raw, unchanneled potential, a mind not yet burdened by the limitations of conventional thought, that captivated Hammond. Wu was a prodigy, having been drawn to the sciences from a very young age, and had found a surrogate home within the confines of this specific biology lab. He spent most of his time here not just for research, but because the head of the lab, a female professor renowned for her unconventional methods and deep dedication, had become a crucial maternal figure in his young life. This attachment deepened after the loss of his own mother in '74, an event that had sent his father, a scientist himself, into a deep depression, eventually causing him to resign his position at Genentech and withdraw from Henry's life. It was within this unique, almost familial, sphere that Hammond found his target. He began spending more time observing the student, engaging him in discussions that cautiously explored the burgeoning field of genetic manipulation, conversations that danced on the very edges of established ethics and scientific ambition.

Eventually, Hammond decided it was time to clarify his intentions and It wasn't too hard, as he had been the own founding the university. He extended an invitation to Wu, proposing a dinner, an affair meticulously orchestrated to impress and subtly persuade or manipulate, a calculated first step towards a partnership that would reshape the very fabric of life.

“Henry, my boy, thank you for coming,” Hammond said, the warmth in his voice almost palpable as they settled into the plush surroundings of the restaurant. The setting itself was a statement, chosen for its subtle opulence.

"Thank you for inviting me, Mr. um…” Wu hesitated, trying to remember the name he knew but couldn’t immediately recall.

"Hammond. But please, call me John. I like you, I really do. I have a gift for reading people." Hammond saw immense, untapped potential. Wu possessed not only intelligence, but also boundless, unchanneled energy perfectly suited to Hammond's goals. Wu was undeniably young—precisely the kind of mind that would be molded. Hammond steered the conversation. "What do you plan on pursuing after you complete your studies at this esteemed university?" 

"Oh, um, I plan to continue my research," Wu began, a hint of the conventional academic path in his answer, "and perhaps explore a few other disciplines." 

"Nonsense, that would be a profound waste of your talent," Hammond interjected, the dismissal sharp and absolute. He allowed no room for debate. "Universities are the backwater. Don’t look so surprised."

"Why?" Wu's youthful surprise was genuine.

"Because," Hammond explained, adopting a conspiratorial tone, "you possess immense potential, Henry. And I intend to offer you an opportunity far beyond the confines of any university." 

"What exactly do you mean?" Wu asked, barely containing his rapidly growing intrigue.

"A job in Bio-genetics, focusing on Lizards," Hammond replied, his eyes gleaming with the predatory ambition of a man who saw no limits to his vision. "The exploration, the definitive realization, of cloning. I’ve already secured a partnership with the Dark Order. They’ve agreed to provide their most advanced tools and a full spectrum of their technology with a consult that will work close. However," Hammond paused, the silence heavy, "they informed me specifically that your unique perspective, your fresh, unburdened approach—it’s precisely what is required to push the boundaries of this science beyond current theoretical limits." 

"Wait, what!? Really? Are you sure?" Wu asked, his voice cracking slightly, the implications of the Order's involvement and the scale of the claim almost overwhelming him.

“Yes, my boy,” Hammond replied smoothly. “We need you. To sweeten the deal, my associate and I will pay you twenty-five million each, and we won’t tell you how to spend your money, nor will we interfere with your work. You’ll have the freedom to experiment as you wish, using their advanced toys.” 

“Oh my, If the Order is involved, then that makes everything… interesting,” Wu stammered, his mind racing with possibilities, his heart pounding. 

“And would I be able to publish my research and developments online for the world to see?” Wu asked, curiosity sharpening his tone. 

“In time, you will. Just not immediately.” Hammond responded. “Think about it, Henry. This is a chance to make history. Together, we could redefine the limits of what’s possible.”

Wu hesitated, the weight of the proposition settling heavily in the air. The young geneticist found himself at a crossroads. The promise of scientific discovery beckoned, but the specter of ethical responsibility whispered caution. 

Wu’s instincts kicked in; he sensed there was more to the offer than Hammond was revealing. He asked carefully, “What did you mean by ‘lizards?’ If I’m going to accept your offer, I want to know what I’ll be working with.” 

“All you need to know, my boy, is that we’re talking about lizards. Big ones,” Hammond replied cryptically, his smile widening. 

He slid a small piece of paper across the table, revealing an airport address: Ohio_1019-383-2032. With that, Hammond stood, his presence commanding as he prepared to leave. “Think it over, Henry. Your future is in your hands—and I can make you rich and famous.”

As Hammond walked away, Wu stared at the paper, the weight of the decision pressing down on him. The allure of groundbreaking research and the promise of fame danced tantalizingly in his mind, but uncertainty gnawed at his gut.

*(Henry Wu: The Final Call: Choice)*

The following day, Henry Wu paced in the office of his professor, Dr. Evelyn Carter. A woman at age 55, Dr. Carter possessed a quiet authority. Her light brown hair, flecked with gray, was often haphazardly pinned. She wore practical, well-worn tweed jackets over sturdy blouses. Her face, though marked by lines of age, was dominated by sharp, intelligent blue eyes. She was the renowned geneticist of this university, known for her work in evolutionary biology, with a reputation that extended beyond the campus. The walls of her office were adorned with photographs of her fieldwork. For Henry, she was more than a mentor; she had become his maternal figure, a fixed point in his shifting world. He knew she would recognize the potential pitfalls better than anyone else.

“Henry my boy! You’re back,” Dr. Carter said, a warm smile lighting up her face. “I was just analyzing some fascinating data on genetic mutations in amphibians. What brings you here?”

Wu took a deep breath. “I met with John Hammond last night.”

Dr. Carter’s eyebrows rose. “Hammond? What did he want?”

“He offered me a job,” Wu said, his voice hesitant. “Working on cloning. With the Dark Order’s technology.”

Dr. Carter’s expression turned thoughtful. “The Dark Order… that’s interesting. What are your thoughts?”

“It’s a huge opportunity,” Wu admitted. “Twenty-five million dollars, complete freedom to experiment… but it also feels… I don’t know. Risky.”

Dr. Carter nodded slowly. “It can and might be a risk. But risk is often part of discovery. What specifically is bothering you?”

“I’m not sure I trust Hammond,” Wu said. “He’s very charismatic, but I get the feeling he’s not telling me everything.”

Dr. Carter considered this. “Trust your instincts my boy. But don’t let uncertainty paralyze you. Think carefully about what you want, what you’re willing to do to achieve it, and what goes or comes next and after, and then make your decision.”

Wu nodded, still troubled. “I want to make discoveries, Professor. But I also want to do it the right way.”

Dr. Carter smiled. “Of course you do, Henry. Just remember, every great discovery comes with its own set of challenges, you don't have to do it now I mean you're only 16 but way smarter than the others.”

A month after Dr. Carter spoke with Wu about Hammond’s proposal, she was driving home late one evening. The city lights smeared across her windshield. Unbeknownst to her, a white truck, unmistakably a Chevrolet Step Van with a plain white exterior and a squared-off cargo body with the words BioSyn on the sides, followed her closely. Its headlights, twin beams of cold light, cut through the deepening darkness.

As Dr. Carter approached an intersection, the truck accelerated. Its engine roared, a sudden, guttural sound in the night. It closed in fast and veered to the side. The maneuver was clean, practiced—a textbook pit. The truck clipped her rear bumper just enough to spin the car. She lost control. Her vehicle twisted violently across the slick asphalt, a crumpling mass of steel, before slamming into a nearby lamppost with a sickening crunch.

The Chevrolet paused—just for a moment. Then it continued on, unhurried, disappearing into the city's labyrinthine streets and the shroud of the night. Its license plate caught the light just once before vanishing: ORDER 66.The following day, after the accident that left her hospitalized, Wu visited her regularly, their conversations often circling back to Hammond and the offer. He'd spoken with Hammond himself a few more times now, the man's charisma undeniable, yet a persistent unease lingered in Wu's gut. He hadn't witnessed the crash; he'd only heard about it later when he was called from the hospital, the news hitting him with the force of a physical blow.

One quiet afternoon, Wu sat by Dr. Carter’s bedside. The fluorescent hospital lights hummed, a stark contrast to the familiar warmth of her university lab. He watched the steady rise and fall of her chest, the pale complexion. The bandage on her head, stark white against her graying hair, was a constant reminder of the sudden, brutal nature of the crash.

"Professor," he began, his voice softer than usual. "How are you feeling today? Any improvement?"

Dr. Carter opened her eyes, with a flicker of her usual sharp intelligence still present, though dimmed by pain. "As well as can be expected, Henry. The doctors assure me recovery is expected. Though," she managed a weak smile, "fieldwork for the next year is likely compromised." She paused, then observed him closely. "You seem preoccupied. Has Hammond been in touch again?"

Wu hesitated, glancing around the sterile room. "Yes, he has. A few times. And... Professor, I've been thinking about his offer. The one discussed. Reservations still exist." The words hung in the air.

Dr. Carter looked at him, her eyes wise and knowing. “I understand, Henry. It's a big decision.”

“It's more than that,” Wu explained. “It's… I don't know. Hammond's vision is compelling, but I’m worried about the cost. He talks about pushing boundaries, but I get the feeling he's more interested in the 'wow' factor than the actual science.”

Dr. Carter nodded thoughtfully. “He's a businessman, Henry. That’s part of it. But that doesn't negate the potential. Think of what you could accomplish with his resources. The discoveries you could make.”

Wu sighed. “I know. That's what keeps me up at night. The possibilities are endless. But I also worry about the ethical implications. What if we cross a line we shouldn't?”

Dr. Carter’s expression turned serious. “That's a valid concern, Henry. And it’s one you must grapple with. But remember, science isn't about avoiding risks. It's about understanding them, mitigating them, and pushing forward despite them. You have the intellect and the moral compass to navigate those challenges. Don’t let fear paralyze you.”

Wu considered her words, the weight of his decision pressing down on him. He respected Dr. Carter's judgment, but he also knew he had to make this choice for himself.

“I'll think about it some more, Professor.”

Dr. Carter smiled sadly. “That's all I ask, Henry. Just… don't let this opportunity pass you by because of fear. The world needs brilliance like yours. It needs your discoveries.”

A few weeks later, Wu received one of the worst calls of his life. Dr. Carter’s condition had taken a turn for the worse. He rushed to her side, but it was too late. She was gone, the cause of death unknown.

The news hit Wu hard. He felt lost and adrift. Dr. Carter had been everything to him. The university, his haven, suddenly felt empty without her. He thought of their conversations and her unwavering belief in his potential. He knew what he had to do.

A few days later of processing the loss, Wu called Hammond.

“Mr. Hammond,” he said, his voice quiet but firm. “I've decided to accept your offer.”

Wu’s words hung in the air, the weight of his decision palpable.

Hammond leaned back in his chair, a slow smile spreading across his face. He steepled his fingers, his eyes gleaming with anticipation.

“Good, Henry,” he said, his voice resonating with genuine enthusiasm yet unaware of the true reason behind the choice. “This is truly… magnificent.”

He paused, a thoughtful look crossing his features before his smile broadened again.

“We will create something so astounding that it will capture the imagination of the entire world,” he declared, his voice filled with a sense of wonder. “And,” he added, “we shall spare no expense.” he ended 

*(The Beginning of Henry Wu's Downfall)*

Henry Wu stood just inside the terminal doors of the Ohid International Airport ready to leave, his suitcase on the polished floor beside him. He scanned the arrivals hall, nerves tightening in his chest, and when John Hammond emerged—tall, silver-haired, eyes bright beneath bushy brows—Henry breathed a small sigh of relief. Hammond offered a warm, unhurried smile.

“Henry,” Hammond greeted, extending a hand. “Good to see you.”

Henry managed a nod, slipping his suitcase handle into Hammond’s free hand, but something in Henry’s posture—his drawn shoulders, the way he avoided eye contact—didn’t escape Hammond, yet he said nothing. “Lockwood sends his regrets,” Hammond added casually. “Family obligations.”

Henry forced a smile. “I understand.”

They strode together through the wide glass doors onto the tarmac, Hammond leading him to a sleek white private jet, white and slick ASSAULT FALCON 20F-5. Henry hardly registered the roar of its engines as they climbed aboard, the plush leather seats and low hum of air-conditioning creating a surreal calm inside as they took their seats.

“Coffee?” Hammond offered, sliding into the seat opposite. Henry nodded, and Hammond waved to the flight attendant.

As the jet lifted, Henry pressed his forehead against the cool window, watching Chicago shrink beneath them. He caught Hammond’s gaze in the reflection—curiosity softening the older man’s eyes—but before Henry could frame an excuse, Hammond asked quietly, “You all right kid?”

Henry cleared his throat. “Just… taking it in.”

“Fair enough,” Hammond replied, settling back as the world fell away beneath them.

After a long flight, the jet began its final descent, curving over the verdant expanse of the Animal Kingdom administrative complex. Below, a private runway, carefully integrated into the landscape, appeared. The aircraft touched down smoothly, its landing gear absorbing the shock with practiced efficiency. As John and Wu exited the aircraft, a wide helipad lay empty, awaiting the next arrival. 

Then, with an almost silent grace, two black Tie-Interceptors accompanied by five black X-Wings descended in a disciplined formation. Their engines hummed. The escorts parted, circling in precise formations high above the zoo complex as a sleek black shuttle began its descent. This was the "Destiny", James's personal transport, a Lambda-class shuttle designated as the VK-4b. Unlike standard Imperial shuttles of the old Imperial era, the VK designation traced its lineage not to the Emperor's early fleet, but to a unique collaboration between his Order and German engineers during the First World War—a period when innovative yet brutal vehicle designs like the A7V tank were emerging. The original designs, forged in meetings and sketches during 1914, reflected Germany's advanced manufacturing capabilities, which the Order appreciated despite not supporting their role as the Axis power. The design work, heavily influenced by engineers from Krupp, the renowned German arms manufacturer, laid the groundwork for this advanced craft, this move made to seek new perspectives as the Dark Order prepared for a gradual reveal to Earth,. The specific model, VK-4b, was a direct descendant and a superior successor to the original Lambda-class T-4a shuttle, which the Order had deemed unsuitable for their rigorous demands. Its construction was ultimately entrusted to Kuat Drive Yards (KDY), the formidable Imperial manufacturing giant responsible for the Imperial-class Star Destroyers, recognizing KDY's unparalleled success, tasked them with bringing the Earth-designs to life. But this specific ship was special, Destiny was the very vessel on which James, as a child, had first been smuggled aboard, a moment linked to a pivotal, traumatic event in his youth and his eventual placement within the Order by his caretakers. As the shuttle approached the landing zone, the lower articulated wings began their silent, mechanical ascent, folding upward, reducing the vessel's silhouette. This retraction, a precisely calibrated maneuver, protected its occupants as it settled onto its retractable struts with a dignity that bordered on arrogance, the sheer engineering prowess evident in its flawless execution. 

The shuttle’s primary ventral ramp lowered with a hydraulic sigh. From the shadowed opening, two Royal Guards emerged. Clad in distinctive crimson robes and helmets, their cortosis armor glimmered subtly in the afternoon light. They moved with an almost ritualistic precision, sweeping down the ramp and taking up positions flanking the hatch, their Force Pikes held rigidly. Behind them, James appeared, his white and red armor contrasting sharply with the customary armor of his guards. He carried his helmet casually under one arm, walking with measured steps. Following him were six Death Troopers, their imposing frames encased in black vibramium armor. They moved with a chilling synchronization, their modified voices scrambling in low, encrypted bursts through their helmets. They carried large, reinforced crates, each stamped with the austere red emblem of the Dark Order, symbols of authority and secret cargo. Bringing up the rear was Admiral Kassius Konstantine, a man of light skin, brown hair, and blue eyes. He held a slim data-tablet, its surface reflecting the bright sky, his expression one of controlled assessment. 

Henry stiffened. He’d never met James in person—only on television and in newspapers—and the sight of him now, a man of such apparent authority, sparked a strange combination of awe and excitement. Hammond, ever the grand host, moved forward to greet the arriving VIP. 

“Ah... James—you made it on time... thank you for coming,” Hammond said. 

Admiral Konstantine handed James the tablet, James made final checks before handing it to Hammond. His gaze flicked to the young student beside Hammond, lingering for a moment on Henry's slender frame, his obvious youth. A subtle tension entered James's posture, his jaw tightening almost imperceptibly. "Everything your scientist or geneticist will need is in those boxes. Everything has been supplied, coordinated, and inspected by my consultant for the project, Dr. Lucy Kim," he replied, his voice low, then turned his gaze fully to Hammond, the concern in his eyes stark and undeniable. "Are you certain about him, Mr. Hammond? Getting a child this young involved in a project with this class of high-stakes... Don't you think it could get to his head one day if, say, you're not around or something happens? That kind of isolation, the power of playing God... It can change the way a man thinks and views. Turning them into something else."

Hammond chuckled, his confidence clear. "Youthful ambition can be guided correctly and be a potent asset," Hammond said. "And his talent is simply unparalleled." He clapped James lightly on the shoulder. "Besides, I decide how far the leash extends. Henry will be precisely where I need him, doing exactly what he is told." 

Robert Muldoon soon stepped forward, interrupting the exchange. Muldoon's new Zoo attire was practical: a tan utility vest over a lightweight shirt and cargo trousers. Colors blended with natural environments. Slung casually over one shoulder was his old Mossberg 500 shotgun. Muldoon's hunter's eyes were deep-set, almond-shaped, and focused, constantly scanning.

"Agent James, welcome," Muldoon said. "I’ve heard good things."

James took Muldoon’s hand. "Thank you." 

Muldoon offered a brief smile. "John has arranged a secure room for the equipment." 

Hammond and Muldoon led the way down a corridor with glass panels. James fell in beside Henry as they climbed into a Jeep CJ-5. The engine rumbled to life, punctuating their silence. 

As the Jeep started moving, Henry exhaled, betraying raw, nervous tension. James, seated beside him, glanced over. "What’s wrong, kid? You look like you just made a groundbreaking discovery but are thoroughly miserable about it." 

"It’s been… a rough few months," Henry admitted, his voice barely a whisper above the engine's drone, thick with unshed tears. The memory of his professor, Dr. Carter, in the hospital bed, the stark white bandage, the pale skin, the flicker of her usual sharp intellect dimmed by pain—it all resurfaced, twisting in his gut. "I lost someone very important—my mentor, Dr. Carter." He paused, his gaze fixed on a distant point, the words laden with a grief that felt too vast for his young frame. "She was more than just a professor; she became... like a second mother to me after my own passed away. She saw my potential, helped me find this place, believed in me more than anyone. Truly. I keep thinking she’d have warned me, really warned me, if this was a mistake, a terrible mistake." His voice broke on the last word. 

James’s expression softened, revealing genuine empathy that surprised Henry. He remained silent for a moment, then nodded slowly. "It's never easy, kid," he finally replied, his voice low against the Jeep's drone. "Losing someone who anchors you... someone who guides your work and your life... it leaves a profound, aching void. That particular form of loss is acutely familiar." He shook his head slightly as he raised his helmet staring at its visor, a shadow crossing his features, the weight of his own experiences clear in his voice. "I've endured many losses in my life—colleagues, comrades, even those I considered family. When that anchor is gone, you face a choice: find a new compass, or build your own. But when that guide is removed... the path can shift unexpectedly. Power, unchecked ambition, the desire to prove oneself without restraint—these become powerful, dangerous forces that can twist the finest intentions into something unrecognizable. Follow them long enough, and you become the very thing your mentor would have warned you against." He gave Henry a brief, understanding look, his dark eyes conveying a depth of experience far beyond his youthful appearance, as he lowered the helmet. "If this truly aligns with what she taught you, then you honor her memory by pursuing it. If not, if that gut instinct whispers caution... get out. Because once you step onto this particular path, there's rarely a clear way back. The cost can be immeasurable. It can make you capable of things you'd never imagine, justify actions you swore you'd never take. It could turn a brilliant mind into a weapon, leaving the man behind, leaving behind any chance of finding peace or redemption for the choices made. As a great mentor once told me: Ambition can seduce the mind, but beware it often leads to ethical shadows and moral compromises with regrets." 

Henry met James's eyes, gratitude mixed with cold dread. He swallowed hard, the weight of James's words settling deep within him. "Thank you."

Soon, the Jeep arrived at the manager’s meeting building. James and Henry quickly get off the jeep matching pace with Hammond and Muldoon, following them to the entrance.

Henry and James paused at the threshold, the sudden silence of the conference room noticeable after the hum of the Jeep. Each absorbed the room’s subtle aura of anticipation. Then, in unison, they stepped forward. The heavy doors closed with a click, as Muldoon left to help with the boxes. The meeting had begun.
