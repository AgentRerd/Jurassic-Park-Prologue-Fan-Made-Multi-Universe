Chapter I: The Dawn of the Jurassic Idea

"In the pursuit of greatness, ambition can illuminate our path or cast a shadow of peril."

*PROLOGUE*

In the heart of Africa, where the wild roams free and ambition knows no bounds, one man's dream teeters on the edge of reality. John Alfred Parker Hammond, born in 1913, a rich visionary driven by the thrill of innovation, seeks to redefine the future. From the whimsical charm of his flea circus, a venture he began in the 1940s, to the grand aspirations of creating a place of wonder, something people can truly see and touch, Hammond's quest for greatness will challenge the very fabric of nature itself. Will his ambition illuminate the path to success? Or cast a shadow of peril? The stage is set, and the adventure begins... (The question is: where will it lead?)

*(The Beginning of John Hammond's Journey; Petticoat Lane)*

In 1960, John Alfred Parker Hammond a charismatic entrepreneur with an insatiable drive for innovation and spectacle, age 47, launched his first ambitious endeavor after leaving Scotland. He was a man of medium height, with a frame that, even then, carried the beginnings of a comfortable prosperity, and a perpetually smiling face framed by a receding hairline and bright blue eyes. He favored crisp, white suits.

Hammond’s venture, a "Flea Circus" housed in Petticoat Lane, London, England, was, in essence, a triumph of presentation over reality. He had, with remarkable ingenuity and more than a little sleight-of-hand, crafted an illusion of tiny acrobats and daring feats performed by trained insects, fleas. The local populace, drawn in by his effusive promises and the sheer novelty of the concept, flocked to witness the spectacle.

For a time, the circus thrived on the public’s eagerness to believe in the extraordinary, regardless of its foundation in truth. However, like many enterprises built on such a foundation, it proved unsustainable. Financial mismanagement, coupled with the inevitable waning of initial excitement, led to its eventual collapse. The failure was a bitter and public blow, but it instilled in Hammond an unyielding resolve: his next creation would be flawless, whatever it would be, would be built on the bedrock of genuine, tangible marvels, not on the shifting sands of mere illusion. This experience, a seemingly minor setback in the grand scheme of his ambition, would prove to be a crucial turning point, shaping the audacious vision that would one day redefine the very boundaries of scientific possibility on earth.

Refusing to let the setback define him, Hammond redirected his energies toward a more ambitious project. In 1969, he opened "Animal Kingdom" in Nairobi, Kenya, a sprawling zoo designed to educate the public about wildlife and conservation. Yet, even as he watched the animals roam in their enclosures, a deeper yearning stirred within him. He envisioned a theme park that would not only showcase living creatures but also, somehow, resurrect extinct species of the past through the wonders of cloning—an idea he had been thinking of for a while, but he just didn't know how, so he continued progress on the zoo.

Weeks after Animal Kingdom's opening, Hammond sought out a young man named Robert Muldoon. Muldoon, a 21 year old man with a grim face and a deep respect for wildlife, had been a legendary hunter in Africa. He was known for tracking, hunting, and understanding animal behavior. His experiences with apex predators instilled caution, an awareness of the wild's balance.

Muldoon's attire mirrored his pragmatism. He favored tan, short-sleeved safari shirts, worn soft from countless hours in the sun and dust. A wide belt cinched his waist, holding a holstered M1911 pistol – a tool, not a trophy. Khaki cargo shorts, stained and scuffed, offered freedom of movement through the dense jungle undergrowth, their pockets filled with the necessary accoutrements of his trade. Rugged leather boots, scarred by countless expeditions, completed the ensemble, and a broad-brimmed safari hat perpetually shaded his steel-blue eyes from the relentless sun. Slung across his back, always within easy reach, was his chosen weapon for the hunts: a Mossberg 500 pump-action shotgun.

After two months of searching, Hammond finally located Muldoon and brought him on board as the park's warden and head of security for Animal Kingdom, Muldoon possessed the intuitive understanding of the animals from his lifetime spent in Kenya. He had learned to manage and protect, a gamekeeper as much as a hunter, a valuable skill in the burgeoning world of zoos. But this new venture, a kingdom of animals, promised challenges no safari could replicate. 

In 1974, despite the success of Animal Kingdom, Hammond was dissatisfied. The zoo was a stepping stone toward the grander vision of the unique theme park he so wished, yet this was not it. In a bold move he left the zoo, entrusting its daily operations to Muldoon, but retained the ownership. Hammond's sights were set on a new path, one that led him to Sir Benjamin Lockwood, a billionaire philanthropist and businessman whose resources, Hammond believed, could transform his dream into a reality.

Sir Lockwood, a British entrepreneur age 36, moved through the world with the quiet confidence of inherited wealth and a sharp, calculating intellect. His influence, though not publicly flaunted, was considerable in certain circles. He dressed in impeccably tailored suits, the fabrics whispering of expense and refinement. A hint of his British origins lingered in his precise speech, yet it was subtly softened, reshaped by a relatively recent relocation to the United States. His features were sharp, his gaze often contemplative, and he carried himself with an air of thoughtful ambition, a man clearly accustomed to orchestrating grand endeavors. His wealth and shrewd business acumen, combined with Hammond's audacious vision, would soon converge, setting the stage for a collaboration that promised to redefine the scope of human enterprise and entertainment.

By 1975, Hammond had secured the partnership with Lockwood, and with it, access to advanced technology, the kind that whispered of unimaginable possibilities. Yet, a crucial void remained. He needed more than equipment; he needed a specific kind of expertise and, perhaps more critically, a shield. He envisioned operating outside conventional scrutiny, beyond the reach of federal oversight or any agency that might seek to halt his grand plan, a timeline for which was set for 1994. The true key, he knew, lay not in the realm of earthly law or established scientific circles, but within the enigmatic influence of the "Dark Order." An intergalactic military force, with capabilities far beyond human comprehension. Though neither he nor Lockwood held significant rank within its hierarchy, nor could they identify anyone of influence who might intercede, the vastness of the challenge loomed, threatening to render his bold ambition extinct before it can ever begin.

*(Kix the Medic who Changed Everything)*

One day, Hammond had an unexpected accident at his grand estate in New York, Avenue. Local first responders arrived swiftly, including a Dark Order Response Unit, #6116-555_501, a black modified Phase II Clone Trooper medic, adorned with striking blue stripes. This medic moved with a calculated grace, a sign of years of training and battlefield experience. As he worked to stabilize the entrepreneur, he removed his helmet. Hammond noticed subtle differences in the medic's demeanor and appearance. He recognized the unmistakable traits of a clone trooper. Hammond was unsure at first, because unlike the Grand Army of the Republic, which used similar-looking armor for their clones, the Order allowed its soldiers to pick whichever armor class they wanted, making it difficult to tell the difference.

A conversation followed. Hammond, with his captivating charm, drew the clone medic into a discussion about his origins. The medic spoke of his home planet, Kamino, a watery world in Wild Space beyond the Rishi Maze, where life revolved around the massive cloning facilities of Tipoca City. He recounted the tale of Jango Fett, a legendary Mandalorian bounty hunter whose genetic template formed the foundation of the Grand Army of the Republic and now, somehow the Order's. He detailed the meticulous process: the extraction and modification of Fett's DNA, eliminating flaws and enhancing desirable traits like loyalty and obedience, resulting in an accelerated growth rate that brought a clone to maturity in half the time of a natural human, but now removed by the Order's Emperor. He also alluded to a public presence and a celebrated war hero stationed in New York, Brooklyn, a figure of great renown within the Order.

As Hammond absorbed the information, a spark ignited within him, illuminating the path to his grand vision. The pieces of his audacious plan were falling into place. The Order offered everything he sought: a discreet, powerful force that operated beyond the confines of ordinary law, with the advanced technology to clone and rapidly accelerate the growth of any organism, a process that could bring his prehistoric dreams to life. He was unwavering in his determination to see his vision realized, no matter the cost.

"Thank you for everything," Hammond said, his voice filled with appreciation. "The assistance has been invaluable. And, um… what's your name?"

"CT-6116 of the 501st, sir, but the Order calls me Kix," the medic replied, with the respect and professionalism of a soldier. Kix and the other local F.D.N.F. paramedics departed, leaving John Hammond to his thoughts. He immediately began researching the Order, its cloning methods, and the war hero Kix had mentioned, setting Hammond on a dangerous course.

*(The Dark Order's Backstory)*

The Dark Order, a formidable army forged from a synthesis of old and renewed resources from the Separatist Alliance, the Galactic Republic (both old and new), the Imperial Empire, the First Order, the Final Order, and other similar factions, projected an aura of intimidation through its troopers. These soldiers were clad in black and white armor, with many possessing color stripings of all sorts and marked legions, all were adapted for every class of environment, and wielded advanced weaponry. When asked about their imposing presence, the Emperor of the Order offered a chillingly simple justification: "Intimidation will make our enemies rethink their choices before crossing us, or our allies."

The Dark Order had first emerged during the First World War, with speculation about its origins persisting even further into the past, some tracing its existence back to the time of Jesus Christ. This army's advanced technology and seemingly unnatural abilities, to resurrect people from the dead and time travel fueled the speculation surrounding its ancient roots. Following the Second World War, the Order solidified its presence on Earth by signing treaties with governments across the globe. It maintained a stance of neutrality throughout the global conflicts until the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 7, 1941.

Japan, misjudging the Order's strength and resolve for their "No entry war doctrine," as a sign of weakness, launched an attack on a repurposed Acclamator-Class assault ship named the DOA Facilitator. Painted white with two prominent red crosses on its sides (right and left)the vessel clearly serving as a public hospital for the innocent victims of war. This unprovoked assault, a blatant violation of every humanitarian principle the Order held dear, was a wound that cut deeper than any conventional military defeat. For the Emperor, who had long cultivated the Order's neutral stance, the destruction of the Facilitator and the needless loss of life ignited a cold fury. Many Dark Order members had lost friends and even family in the attack, and for the first time, a profound sense of brokenness settled upon the Order's leadership. In this moment of moral anguish and shattered neutrality, Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin, a high-ranking admiral of the Order's Naval Space Fleet, swayed the Emperor to embrace a new, harsher doctrine. Tarkin argued that "fear will keep the army's in line," convincing the Emperor that sometimes brute force was necessary to enforce their uncompromising vision of order. The Emperor, though hesitant, agreed to adopt elements of the very Tarkin Doctrine he once abhorred, believing it was the only way to prevent future atrocities.

The attack was a grave violation of international law. The assault resulted in the destruction of both the Facilitator whose main shields were down and Pearl Harbor, which was never ready. Over 15,000 American lives were lost, including military personnel and civilians, alongside 5,000 Dark Order personnel. The attack had also claimed several US Navy ships, including the battleships USS Arizona (which alone accounted for 1,177 lost servicemen) and USS Oklahoma, the training vessel USS Utah, and destroyers USS Cassin and USS Downes. Unbeknownst to the Emperor, Tarkin had already pitched the Manhattan Project to America, conveniently omitting the nuclear aspect from his discussions with his superior. It was a retaliatory act that sent shock waves throughout the Order and damaged its global reputation. Tarkin orchestrated a bombardment of Japanese military facilities and also facilitated the secret transport and assembly of the nuclear bombs Little Boy and Fat Man. Although the credit for the bombings went to the United States under President Truman, the Order's involvement remained classified. The bombings had brought the war to an abrupt and tragic end, resulting in an estimated 140,000 deaths in Hiroshima and a further 74,000 in Nagasaki by the end of 1945. The catastrophic loss created a disturbance in the Force that the Emperor of the Order felt as profoundly as Alderaan's destruction by the Death Star in 0 BBY: feeling many lives end in seconds with no purpose. This devastating outcome, particularly the use of nuclear weapons, was viewed by the Emperor as a profound breach of trust by Tarkin, who had gone far beyond the agreed-upon tenets of the newly accepted doctrine. For this, Tarkin would be publicly sanctioned, marking the very limits of the Order's new, brutal approach.

Following Japan’s official surrender in August 1945, the global conflict, in its broadest sense, ended. Yet pockets of resistance, tenacious and often isolated, remained. Japanese holdouts across remote Pacific islands, cut off from information or simply refusing to accept the defeat, continued their fight. Some, like Hiroo Onoda in the Philippines, would persist for decades, a testament to the power of unwavering conviction in the face of overwhelming odds. In Europe, the collapse of Nazi Germany in May did not signify eradication. Remnants of the regime scattered, retreating into the subterranean networks of the continent. Groups such as Hydra, born from esoteric Nazi occult research and clandestine scientific experiments, continued their operations in secret. Their cells, sometimes aided by the shadowy networks of ODESSA (Organization of Former SS Members), eluded both Allied forces and the active Dark Order forces.

In the aftermath of the devastation, Dark Order teams were dispatched. One such troop, designated MT-4787-RS, operating under the command of MT-2004, a Sargent. Their initial mandate involved tactical support and civilian evacuation, missions requiring precision and a degree of detachment from the ongoing chaos. However, the operational parameters quickly shifted. These missions increasingly spiraled into direct conflicts with rogue factions. Despite Japan's formal withdrawal, the vestiges of Germany's military, the shadowy apparatus of Hydra, and even elements of fascist Italy remained adversaries. Reports indicated these disparate groups, driven by fractured ideologies and sheer will, actively obstructed the Order’s rescue efforts in war-torn zones—a complication rarely encountered by traditional relief organizations, forcing the Order to become more aggressive and kill on site. the "kill on sight" directive, a stark departure from their previous protocols, was not a sudden impulse. It was born from the crucible of the war itself, solidified by a new, secondary doctrine established after a grim incident in 1942: the Laconia Doctrine. During the Laconia Incident, when American forces attacked a German U-boat rescuing survivors under a Red Cross flag, the Dark Order made an unprecedented public display of its brutal new doctrine. The American aircrew and their commanders were summarily executed by Dark Order troopers in front of stunned onlookers. This act, directly mirroring the Emperor's cold fury over the Facilitator's destruction, signaled that any abuse of humanitarian symbols would be met with immediate, visible, and unforgiving retribution, regardless of nation or allegiance.

The public perception of the Dark Order, particularly in its humanitarian efforts, often overshadowed its military capabilities and dark deeds. They provided extensive aid to all civilians affected by the war, a policy enforced without regard to nationality or former allegiance. Every nation, including Japan—still grappling with the incomprehensible losses of Hiroshima and Nagasaki—received assistance. One particular event, however, transcended the mundane details of aid distribution. The Emperor of the Dark Order, a figure shrouded in secrecy, made his first recorded public appearance. Accompanied by his son, Red, the Emperor was among the first to set foot in the irradiated ruins of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The gesture was unprecedented: not merely offering aid, but formally apologizing for the devastation, acknowledging the Order's complicity in the use of the atomic weapons. A single photograph captured the stark reality of the scene and the Emperor's presence.Yet, even as the Emperor made this public overture, a more private form of justice was enacted for what the Order deemed the ultimate war crime. Behind the scenes, and prior to the formal signing of treaties that would grant the Order broader jurisdiction, the pilots responsible for dropping the atomic bombs were discreetly eliminated. Their deaths, arranged by hired bounty hunters like Cad Bane and Boba Fett, were made to look like unfortunate accidents—overdoses, car crashes—ensuring that while the world celebrated its war heroes, the Order's uncompromising code of retribution remained secretly fulfilled.In a subsequent public statement, the Emperor formally sanctioned Grand Moff Tarkin for his role in the bombings, an act of calculated justice intended to reinforce the Order’s stated principles, contrasting sharply with the ruthlessness Tarkin had displayed. This moment, a blend of power, repentance, and public image management, redefined the Order's engagement with the global community.

In the subsequent years, specifically by 1960, the Dark Order, despite its formidable presence, faced significant financial strain. This unforeseen fiscal challenge prompted an unprecedented global initiative: a collaborative effort among Earth's nations and galaxy wide, guided by the Order, to fund and establish public emergency facilities and shelters worldwide and galaxy wide. These structures, including the one in Brooklyn, New York, mentioned by Kix, would serve humanity, emphasizing the Order's shift towards transparent operations within Earth’s established legal frameworks. The Emperor's declaration underscored this new directive: "No one is above the justice system or law," a principle strictly enforced even as various countries offered preferential treatment, which the Order consistently refused. This commitment extended even to their own ranks; Grand Moff Tarkin, despite his previous contributions, faced the full, unyielding weight of Order justice for his unsanctioned use of atomic weapons. Though his specific fate remained an internal secret, it served as a grim reminder to all within the Dark Order that even architects of their newfound might were not exempt from accountability.

Overseeing the intricate negotiations and the Order’s global expansion on Earth was James Vincent Moreno Red Fett, the Governor of the planet. Though his surname, "Red Fett," echoed the legendary bounty hunter Boba Fett, James’s origins were distinct. He was born on Coruscant, but mysteriously landed on Earth, London, as a baby in an emergency escape pod, found in a family's backyard. Subsequently, he was raised in London, United Kingdom, embodying a unique blend of galactic heritage and Earth-based upbringing. His diplomatic acumen proved invaluable, playing a crucial role in negotiating with the remnants of the Italian fascist regime and dismantling the vestiges of the Nazi Party that lingered after Hitler’s suicide.

It was James, working alongside Steve Rogers – Captain America, the very symbol of Allied resistance – who finally confronted Johann Schmidt, the Red Skull, and orchestrated the collapse of Hydra’s final stronghold. This decisive action solidified the Dark Order’s critical, albeit shadowed, role in the history of the mid-20th century. The details remain classified.

Renowned for his diplomatic skills, James played a crucial role in negotiating with Italy and dismantling what remained of the Nazi Party. His work accelerated the end of hidden threats after Hitler’s suicide. It was James, alongside Steve Rogers (Captain America), who helped defeat Johann Schmidt—Red Skull and bring down Hydra’s final stronghold, solidifying the Order’s role in the shadows of history.

*(Planning the Scheme with Benjamin Lockwood)*

John Hammond meticulously tracked the news on James V. Red, his eyes glued to every report until he pinpointed his location: The Public Base for Civilians in Brooklyn, New York, just as Kix had mentioned. A plan began to form in his mind, one that he knew could change everything. “If I can just persuade James to join me, the rest of the world will follow suit. If he refuses, well… a little manipulation wouldn't hurt anyone.” After weeks of research, Hammond finally invited Benjamin Lockwood to his estate for a critical meeting. As they sat across from each other in the tastefully decorated living room, Hammond’s voice was calm but filled with conviction.

“Ben, I want to start small because—”

Lockwood shot him a confused look. “You want to clone dinosaurs. How is that 'small'? There’s nothing small about it. What we are doing is-.”

Hammond leaned forward, his hands clasped together. “What if we could clone an elephant first? Test the technology. If the Dark Order can mass-clone one person, surely an elephant is a reasonable starting point.”

What Hammond didn't fully grasp was the long history of the technology he was considering for elephants. The idea of cloning, which he considered new, was built on earlier work. The start of this advanced biological replication was in 32 BBY on a different planet, more than a thousand years in Earth numbers. Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas secretly commissioned the Kaminoans to create a clone army. This began the process of large-scale genetic duplication. After Tipoca City was destroyed in 19 BBY, a figure working in secret revealed his influence. Emperor Mounter, the hidden leader behind the Dark Order, Resurrected the Kaminoans in 0 BBY, as the Galactic Civil War began.

Mounter acted alone, without official communication or connections to Emperor Palpatine. He gained the support of high-ranking Imperial officers within the Empire and others, promising them eternal life and respect with loyalty for their services and sacrifices. Using their positions, he acquired the resources to build an army of Stormtroopers and Clone Troopers, along with a growing fleet.

By 4 ABY, Tipoca City was meticulously reconstructed. Employing his considerable, often forbidden, powers, the Emperor successfully restored Jango Fett’s DNA. This feat was accomplished after finding a clone adrift in space – Kix, the same clone medic who had been frozen in stasis by the Separatists in 19 BBY. From this recovered genetic source, a new generation of clones was initiated. As the years progressed, his army swelled, becoming a formidable, secret force by 35 ABY. Their fleet comprised a potent mixture of Republic-era Venator-class Star Destroyers, Separatist CIS frigates, eventually expanding to include Imperial and the devastating Xyston-class Star Destroyers.

By 45 ABY, the Emperor had forged an alliance with the New Republic, effectively serving as its shadowy enforcer, upholding peace and justice across the galaxy. However, in 50 ABY, this delicate balance shattered. A mission—Banana Split, involving his elite troops led by his personal Royal Guard Captain James/MT-4787 and Sovereign Protector Commander Stella/FT-9564, a unit designated TS, JR, MAD, LY—ended in betrayal and death. This profound failure and the loss of the team eroded the Emperor's faith in the New Republic. In response, he orchestrated the collapse of the New Republic from within, leveraging its inherent weaknesses and exploiting its corruption. The people were turned against their government, reminiscent of Palpatine's manipulation, but executed with greater subtlety and effectiveness, until the galaxy could no longer ignore the rot at its core. From the ashes of this engineered collapse, the Dark Order rose to power, positioning itself as the new peacekeepers of the galaxy and starting a new beginning, 0 ARC, alongside a nascent New Jedi Order. This New Jedi Order wasn't simply allowed to exist; it was meticulously restructured and effectively re-established by the Emperor himself, cementing its alignment—and ultimate deference—to the Dark Order's vision of peace and justice with Grand Master Yoda as the head of the new and independent Jedi Council.

Lockwood’s disbelief grew. “Wait, what!?”

“Think about it. If we can clone an elephant, surely we can clone dinosaurs. They’re animals, just like any other.”

Lockwood shook his head slowly, doubt creeping into his expression. “With the technology we have now, it would take us centuries. We have the tools, but we’ll likely be dead before it’s ever successful.”

Hammond’s eyes glimmered with an intensity that unnerved Lockwood. “Not if we had their technology.”

Lockwood’s voice dropped. “You’re suggesting we go to the Dark Order? You know they won’t just help us, John. They’re notoriously secretive. I don’t even understand how you got that clone medic to tell you all of this knowledge without being killed for it.”

“You’re right,” Hammond acknowledged, pacing the room, his voice quiet but determined. “They won’t help unless we can find a way to exploit their weaknesses.” He paused for a moment, then added, “But what if we offered them something they couldn’t refuse? We give them 70 percent of the money, because honestly, it’s not about the money. This is about changing the world and they need it more.” He grabbed a soda from a nearby mini-fridge and opened it with a hiss. “If we get their backing to sign off on a deal, we’ll have the world’s attention. Investors will be lining up. I’ll hire a lawyer to handle the rest of it.” He chuckled darkly, a hint of madness in his voice. “Then i can get back right on schedule, we can.”

“But first…” Hammond leaned in closer, “I want to see if I can influence, maybe manipulate this young man in New York. He can set the stage for what will soon be a New Era in motion.” He placed a photograph of a figure clad in red-and-white phase II clone armor on the table. James V. Red stood tall, flanked by UK armed forces and a Churchill tank behind, UK flags behind them."He’s a veteran. Respected too at that. Has many medals—he’s a good kid."

Lockwood’s expression shifted from confusion to shock. Hammond’s obsession was becoming dangerously real, and the idea of manipulating such a well-organized force made him uncomfortable. Still, the allure of Hammond’s vision—of discovery—was too compelling to ignore.

Benjamin hesitated, his voice thick with uncertainty. "I guess… a little bit of manipulation can’t hurt anyone, right?" he forced a smile, trying to convince himself.

"Exactly!" Hammond’s voice boomed, full of energy. "We shall create something so astounding it will capture the imagination of the entire world and we shall spare no expense. We’ll make it happen, no matter what it takes."

Lockwood nodded slowly, but a chill ran down his spine. He understood the stakes. If their plan failed, they wouldn’t be up against local law enforcement nor County and State or even Federal Agents. They’d be facing the Security Bureau of Investigation—the S.B.I—a shadowy entity with in the Order, known for its efficiency, collaborating with agencies like the F.B.I, C.I.A, D.E.A, D.C.F.S, U.S.S.S, E.P.A, etc., and even S.H.I.E.L.D and the T.V.A. Those who crossed them were never heard from again. The thought made Lockwood’s heart race, but the promise of scientific glory—of changing the world—was a powerful temptation.

As he looked at Hammond, he realized just how far they were both willing to go. The abyss before them was growing ever deeper, and they were already teetering on the edge, ready to leap into the unknown.
